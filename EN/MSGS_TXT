Mother gave me this journal and made me promise to use it. So... I guess I just write everything down now? Should be plenty of time while Father chops down the trees she marked. Been a long while since I've gone anywhere with him.. but this is what she wanted, so I guess we both better get used to it.
*674*
Hunt with Atreus
*675*
Father's taking me hunting before we start the journey to the mountain. Mother's wishes were clear—we let the pyre burn, then take her ashes to the highest peak in the realms. I've got to show him I'm ready and I won't get sick anymore. Mom wanted us to scatter them together... I won't let her down!
*676*
Find the Deer
*677*
Can't let that deer get away, time to finish what we started.
*678*
Return to the house
*679*
Wow, Father and I killed a Troll. I always knew he was tough, but I never knew he could move like that. Time to head home to recover.
*680*
Continue towards the mountain
*681*
Father and I have left home and are going to the highest peak in the realm to spread mothers ashes.
*682*
Escape the ruins
*683*
Father beat the stranger at our door, but we’re not safe there anymore. Ready or not, we’re heading for the mountain. \n
First we need to escape this creepy place. Where are all the people?
*684*
Continue towards the mountain
*685*
We survived the monsters and traps that were in the ruins and found the mountain again. Now we are back on the path.
*686*
Hunt with Atreus
*687*
On another hunt. I think Father is trying to take my mind off of what happened before. I won't let him down.
*688*
Find Atreus
*689*
Tracking the boar, I got separated from Father. How'd that happen? I'm always the one trying to keep up.
*690*
Follow the Witch
*691*
I shot the boar, but it was a friendly magic boar and this nice witch’s friend! We need to help her save his life…
*692*
Collect the white-petalled flower
*693*
The witch sent me to the garden out back to gather herbs for the boar. I hope she can heal him.
*694*
Return to Atreus
*695*
We did everything we could for the Boar. When Father is done talking to the witch, it'll be time to get back to our journey.
*696*
Return to the Witch
*697*
Time to bid farewell to the witch and get back on the path... but I can't believe I dropped Mother's knife.
*698*
Get to the boat
*699*
The nice witch drew protection staves on us and showed us a way to reach the mountain by boat. Row towards daylight, she said…
*700*
Boat towards daylight
*701*
Is every witch’s cave full of monsters and treasure chests? I don’t know any other witches, so I guess that’s not weird. Anyways, we found the boat, so we should head towards daylight.
*702*
Follow the Witch
*703*
The Black Breath—some sort of nasty-smelling magick—stopped us at the entrance to the mountain. The friendly Witch from the woods appeared and told us we need the Light of Alfheim, and she’s going to help us get it…
*704*
Realign the bridge
*705*
To get the light we need to dispel the Black Breath, we need to go to Alfheim. To get to Alfheim, we need to realign the bridge so we can use the Realm Travel Room.
*706*
Follow the Witch
*707*
We realigned the bridge and I think we are all set to continue our journey. I'm glad we have The Witch of the Woods here to help.
*708*
Travel to Alfheim
*709*
I've heard stories about Alfheim and the Light Elves from Mother, but I never thought I'd actually get to go there myself. Our goal is to find The Light and dispel the Black Breath, but I can't wait to see what going to another realm is like.
*710*
The Light of Alfheim
*711*
Capture the Light of Alfheim and dispel the Black Breath to reach the mountain.
*712*
Get to the ringed temple
*713*
The light elves and dark elves are fighting an endless war over the light we need. Father doesn’t want to get involved, but we need some of the bifröst light for ourselves if we’re ever going to fulfil mom’s final wish. They cut off the light bridge to the temple, so we’re finding another way in.
*714*
Free the boat
*715*
We ran into our pal Sindri along the beach and also found this boat tangled up in hive tendrils. If we find a way to dislodge it, we can explore further into Alfheim
*716*
Between The Realms
*717*
What lies off the path of the World Tree?
*718*
Find a way into the temple
*719*
The light elves and dark elves are fighting an endless war over the light we need. Father doesn’t want to get involved, but we need some of the Bifröst light for ourselves if we’re ever going to fulfil mom’s final wish. The elves are trying to keep us out, but we’re looking for a way in.
*720*
Reactivate the Ringed Temple bridge
*721*
We found a light bridge leading into the temple, but as soon as we got close it went out. There has to be a way to reactivate it, time to start looking for clues.
*722*
Go back up to the Ringed Temple bridge
*723*
We reactivated the main bridge. Now all we have to do is get back up and cross it. Should be easy, right?
*724*
Find another way into the temple
*725*
Well, the front door was locked. Guess I should have seen that coming. Time to look for another way into the Temple.
*726*
Find a way into the hive
*727*
We're in the temple where they keep the light of Alfheim, but it's all covered up. We need to find a way to free it so we can get what we need for the Bifröst.
*728*
Destroy the hive and claim the light
*729*
So, yea, of course we need to bring this hive down. Things sure seem dire in Alfheim these days. We need the light and the only way we are going to get it is by destroying this hive. Maybe we'll end up helping the Light Elves in the process.
*730*
Find a way out of the temple
*731*
We have the light. Let’s get out of this place.
*732*
Return to the boat
*733*
The Light Elves have returned to Alfheim! I know that this wasn't our original goal, but I feel pretty good about it. Now, we need to find a way back to our boat which is on the other side of the lake. We'll have to go through the trench to get there.
*734*
Return to Týr's Temple
*735*
Now that we have the light of Alfheim captured in the Bifröst, we can return to Midgard and continue our journey to the highest peak.
*736*
Realm travel back to Midgard
*737*
Wow... what a trip. We destroyed the Dark Elf Hive, ended the war, Father disappeared into the Light for what seemed like forever and I had to fight off an entire swarm of Dark Elves. So much has happened since Mom died... but we can't lose sight of our goal to spread her ashes. Time to head back to Midgard and use the Light on the Black Breath.
*738*
Investigate the dead Giant
*739*
Our journey continues! Step one: get a piece of the chisel from the dead giant's hammer.
*740*
Retrieve a piece of the chisel
*741*
We're here and its cold. The giant is huge, so it should be easy enough to make our way over there and get a piece of his hammer... although by this point, I know that nothing is as easy as it seems.
*742*
Find a way to break the ice
*743*
The magic chisel we need a piece of is buried under a lot of ice (and a dead giant stone mason). Father’s got a plan to reach it. I hope it works!
*744*
Retrieve a piece of the chisel
*745*
That chisel is huge, so we'll have to carve a little piece off of it to take with us.
*746*
Return to the boat
*747*
We got to the chisel’s tip, but Thor’s awful sons Magni and Modi attacked us. Father put his axe through Magni’s face and Modi ran away, but I got so angry I almost got sick again. I must fight it! We just need the travel rune to Jötunheim now, and we can finally scatter mom’s ashes…
*748*
Find a way out of Helheim
*749*
I’ve really messed everything up. I killed Modi for what he said about Mom, but Father got angry and we kept arguing all the way to the summit. Then Baldur found us, and in the fighting we destroyed our path to Jötunheim. Now we’ve been sucked into the far side of Hel, and somehow we need to get out of here before we freeze.
*750*
Use the ship
*751*
Maybe this ship is my ticket out of Helheim
*752*
Free the Ship
*753*
Going to need to free the ship if I want to make it out of here
*754*
Escape Helheim
*755*
The boat works just like those flying lanterns in the mountain! If we can free it, and keep it in one piece, maybe we can sail out of Hel alive! \n
Also—Freya is Baldur’s mother!?
*756*
Return to Týr's Vault
*757*
Father told me…. he’s a god, and so am I. I guess not knowing was making me sick. He seems so ashamed, I guess because of how much he hates gods… but Mom always said some of them were good. Anyway—back to Týr’s vault to find the Black Rune!
*758*
Go to Týr's Vault
*759*
Of course Týr wouldn't just leave the Black Rune sitting out. I know it's a vault, but this thing has some serious security.
*760*
Escape the trap
*761*
Well this isn't good...
*762*
Show Týr's key plans to Brok
*763*
These plans seem to lay out how to create a special key.
*764*
Locate Týr's mysterious door
*765*
Brok and Sindri made us the key to enter Týr’s hidden chamber. I have a feeling it’s that door downstairs by the water, on the round part of the temple. If it was important enough for Týr to hide, maybe there’s something inside that can give us a new path to Jötunheim!
*766*
Go back up and flip the temple
*767*
Let's flip this temple!
*769*
It has to be down here somewhere.
*897*
Enter the Völunder Mines
*898*
Brok just asked us to find his Alchemist friend, Andvari, at the Völunder Mines. Father isn't big on helping people for no reward, but Brok DID just give us the entry stone to the Mines… Maybe we should look into it?
*899*
Find the dwarf with a green ring
*900*
Brok isn't sure his friend is still alive, but at least we know he's wearing a green ring. I'll keep an eye out for it while Father is "gathering resources."
*903*
Retrieve the severed hand
*904*
We killed the Soul Eater and found Andvari's ring! And his hand. But… no body. We should look at the ring and make sure it's Andvari's.
*907*
Return to Brok
*908*
I hope Brok isn't too upset about Andvari being dead. I'm not sure exactly what he needed him for, but maybe he'll give us a reward for finding the ring?
*909*
Deus Ex Malachite
*910*
Help Brok find his dead friend Andvari.
*911*
Meet Brok at the Landsuther Mines
*912*
Brok thinks he knows where we might find his dead friend Andvari (the Dwarf whose hand we found). He’ll explain more if we meet him at the Landsuther Mines.
*913*
Search for Andvari's hammer
*914*
So, that ring we found: Andvari's soul is trapped inside! Apparently, he stashed it in there so the Soul Eater wouldn't eat it. Brok wants us to use him to find his fancy hammer. Andvari seems grouchy about it, but I guess I would be too if I were trapped in a ring and some strangers were stealing my stuff.
*915*
Return to Brok
*916*
With Andvari's help (finally), we found his hammer! For a soul trapped in a ring, Andvari sure is talkative. I bet Brok will be happy to have them both!
*917*
Fafnir's Hoard
*918*
Help Sindri find Fafnir's whetstone.
*919*
Head to Fafnir's storeroom
*920*
Sindri told us about the dwarf Fafnir who was renowned for his collection of (stolen) treasures. A treasure-filled storeroom sounds like it might be worth a look. Sindri asked us to keep an eye out for a special whetstone from Niflheim. I just hope nobody got there before us…
*921*
Use entry stone on the pedestal
*922*
We made it inside the Storeroom, but all the rooms are locked. Seems like Fafnir was pretty paranoid about people stealing his stuff. Although I guess since WE'RE here to steal his stuff, he had reason to be. Hopefully Sindri's entry stone will unlock the first room.
*923*
Search for the whetstone
*924*
The first room is open! Maybe we'll find another entry stone inside. We should search every room in here for Sindri's whetstone… and anything else that looks useful. Hopefully the Reavers didn't pick this place clean.
*925*
Talk to the Reaver Spirit
*926*
We're in the last room, and we haven't found a whetstone yet. But there's a spirit here. Maybe he knows something?
*927*
Return to Sindri
*928*
When he was alive, the Reaver Spirit found the whetstone we were looking for… and then his son stabbed him in the back and took it! Father took the dagger from his back, and now we're bringing it back to Sindri. Maybe he'll be able to use it to find his whetstone.
*929*
Family Business
*930*
Retrieve the whetstone.
*931*
Head to the Northri Stronghold
*932*
Sindri used the sigil on the knife we brought him to trace the Reavers to the Northri Stronghold. That's probably where they brought their haul from the storeroom, including that whetstone he keeps going on about. We should check it out and see what we can find.
*933*
Find a way to open the grate
*934*
Looks like these Reavers were just as paranoid as Fafnir. There's a giant metal grate blocking our path. Maybe we can open it using the giant water wheel?
*935*
Explore deeper into the stronghold
*936*
What was this place? We haven't found much so far besides corrupted Reavers. We should go deeper into the Stronghold.
*937*
Investigate the reaver ship
*938*
We found a wrecked Reaver ship, and it looks like things didn't end well for them. We should get down there and take a closer look.
*939*
Return to Sindri
*940*
I can't stop thinking about how this Reaver killed his own father. Why are people so greedy sometimes? At least we found the whetstone Sindri wanted! I wonder what he'll make us with it… once he finishes cleaning the blood off…
*941*
CUT - Inform the Brother of His Own Death
*942*
The Fallen Warrior said we could find his brother near Lookout Tower
*943*
Return to the Fallen Warrior
*944*
We found the brother and told him he was dead… it went poorly. Time to return to the Fallen Warrior.
*945*
The Anatomy of Hope
*946*
Maybe we can talk to Mom again…
*947*
Recover Gullveig's Bones
*948*
Bones Collected: %d of %d \n
This ghost wants us to find this dead lady's bones and bring them back to the rest of her body. She's missing both hands and her head. It's pretty disgusting! But if it works, maybe it'll be worth it…
*949*
Return Gullveig's Bones
*950*
We have all the bones, now we just need to place them with the skeletal corpse next to the spirit guy's body and see what happens. I wonder what this maiden is like… and why they scattered her body parts.
*951*
Speak to the spirit
*952*
We've recovered all the scattered bones of the maiden. Time to bring them back to the spirit and see if he can make good on his word.
*953*
Kill Gullveig
*954*
Father was right.
*955*
Hammer Fall
*956*
Bring down the smaller Thor statue on the island off Veithurgard.
*957*
Destroy the statue of Thor
*958*
We met the ghost of a man who devoted his life to Thor, but now he's turned against him. He wants us to destroy a statue… not the big one in the Lake of Nine, but a smaller one on an island outside the lake, adorned in emerald. As much as Father hates gods, I bet we'll help him out.
*959*
Return to the Disciple of Thor
*960*
Now that we brought down the statue we should probably head back to that spirit and let him know. I also have to remind Father that we were allowed to loot the grave near the statue.
*961*
Elven Artefacts Collected: %d of %d

We've found the vault, now if we can just find that Black Rune, we'll have everything we need to travel to Jötunheim.
*1416*
Retrieve the Black Rune
*1417*
Let's get this stone and get out of here!
*1418*
Return to the Summit
*1419*
At the summit of the mountain, we can finally open the bridge to Jötunheim.
*1431*
Collect Týr's mysterious object
*1447*
Maybe this is the object that the triptych showed opening the path to the tower.
*1591*
Use the Unity Stone
*1592*
Maybe Brok and Sindri will be able to tell us what this talisman does.

Repair the Jötunheim realm travel gate
*3567*
The Jötunheim travel gate is missing its crystal.
*3568*
Talk to Brok and Sindri
*3569*
The trip to Jötunheim failed because we don’t have a travel crystal. We could use Mimir’s eyes if he only had them both, but Odin ran off with one. We’re going to see what Brok and Sindri know about it…
*3571*
Return to the Serpent's horn in Midgard
*3572*
We need Mimir’s eye to travel to Jötunheim. Odin stole his eye and hid it in the statue of Thor. Jörmungandr the World Serpent ate the statue. So, I guess we have to ask the Serpent if we can have it back…?
*3573*
Find Mimir's eye
*3574*
Return to Týr's travel room
*3575*
Mimir has his other eye back! Now we can use it to open the bridge to Jötunheim! We're almost there, Mom!

*3582*
Break the chains
*3583*
The temple is chained down.
*3584*
Return to the Realm Travel Room
*3585*
Now that the temple is upside down, maybe we have access to mysterious object that Týr took so much trouble to hide.
*3586*
Realm Travel to Jötunheim
*3587*
Now that the tower is restored, we should be able to use the realm travel table to reach Jötunheim.
*3588*
Boat into the Serpent's mouth
*3589*
Jörmungandr says we can sail into his belly and look for the Thor statue where Odin hid Mimir’s eye — the last thing we need to get to Jötunheim!

Explore Týr's hidden chamber
*3599*
This is strange...Týr’s secret area surrounds the Realm Travel Room, with an upside-down version of it under the floor. And we can see a magical field just like the one the Black Rune was in, but we have to figure out a way to reach it. I wonder what’s inside and what it has to do with Jötunheim!
*3600*
Return to Týr's travel room
*3601*
We restored the Jötunheim tower! Now we can travel there from the Realm Travel Room in Týr’s Temple. Finally we’ll fulfil mom’s wish…

We made it inside the mountain! Now we need to find a way up to the highest peak, where Mom wanted her ashes scattered.
*3701*
Use the sand bowl lift
*3702*
Traverse the dark caves
*3703*
We dispelled the Black Breath with the Light from Alfheim. Now we need to find a way up to the highest peak, where Mom wanted her ashes scattered.
*3704*
Ascend the Cave Shaft
*3705*
There is a huge cave shaft inside the mountain, there's got to be a way for us to get up there.
*3706*
Reach the summit
*3707*
Well that’s one way to go up. Thankfully there is a huge working lift that should take us the rest of the way to the top. Hopefully it’s sturdy.

*3713*
Return to the mountain
*3714*
We're back in Midgard. Feels like we've been gone forever. The mountain is in sight, we have what we need, let's get back to it.
*3715*
Dispel the Black Breath
*3716*
Our whole trip to Alfheim started when we encountered the Black Breath at Peak's Pass. Now that we have the Alfheim Light, we can dispel it and start ascending the mountain.
*3717*
A New Destination
*3718*
The true highest peak is in Jötunheim, and Mimir's going to help us get there.
*3719*
Take Mimir's head to the Witch
*3720*
There’s a lot happening! At the summit we met Mimir, who made us cut off his head, and said if we can bring him back to life he’ll help us get to Jötunheim. Oh, and apparently GODS are looking for us—Baldur of Asgard and his nephews, the Sons of Thor! I’m so confused. But now we’re heading back to the Witch to see if her magic can wake up Mimir’s head.

*9846*
Enter Motsògnir's Stronghold
*9847*
We have the keys we need to enter the Stronghold. This outside of this place already gives me the creeps, I wonder what we'll find inside.
*9848*
Keys found %d of %d
*9849*
Explore the Stronghold
*9850*
Three keys acquired! We're inside Motsògnir's stronghold, but there's something wrong here. I can hear the screams of those who died. These people suffered, their last moments were spent in fear… The only way to figure out what happened here is to keep exploring.
*9851*
Return to Brok and Sindri's Shop
*9852*
We found the Dwarf King Motsògnir dead in his Stronghold. He was trying to craft the armour too, he just didn't know that the final ingredient was his own ultimate sacrifice. Father says "his loss is our gain," so now all we have to do is take these three ingredients to Brok and Sindri. They're hard to describe… but I'm sure the brothers can figure out what to do with them.

That would explain why the brother who was spouting nonsense would think his brother killed him. Last time we talked to him, he was none too happy, but maybe if we show him this contract and he knows the truth, he can find some peace...

Mother always said Týr was among the most beloved of the gods. Mortals would sail from all over the world to visit his temple and bring him offerings. It seems as if the spirits we’ve met in the Lake of Nine were among those who worshipped the god of law and heroism. These offerings are really nice, I bet Brok or his brother could turn them into something useful like armour.

Travellers are some of the most powerful and well armoured enemies we've fought on our journey. The last one we fought left behind a shard of their armour. I would bet Brok or Sindri could use this to craft an armour set for us. In fact, I bet they could build one that's even stronger than the armour the Travellers themselves wear.

Dragon Shrines Destroyed: %d of %d \n
I had heard whispers of a Dwarf King who was capturing dragons. I didn't think it was possible until we found one chained by three magic shrines. I know they can be dangerous, but it just feels so wrong to keep them chained up. The three shrines in the area are what is keeping Otr in captivity. We'll have to avoid him and break those shrines if we want to set him free.

Fafnir… I've heard the name before. Son of a Dwarf King, guardian of his treasure, cursed by Andvari. If we want to free him, we'll have to break the three shrines that bind him. I know dragons are dangerous, but it seems like Fafnir has been through a lot.

We flipped the temple and found the Unity Stone, which Mimir says should let us go off the path when we’re walking on the World Tree in the Realm Between Realms. This is getting crazy... but if it gets us to Jötunheim, we’ve come too far to quit now!
*18771*

Find Jötunheim's highest peak
*19878*
Mother asked us to scatter her ashes from the highest peak in all the realms, and we’re finally about do it. Could she have known that wish would lead us here to Jötunheim, and everywhere else we’ve been..?
*19879*

*19885*
It was no accident Mom sent us to Jötunheim. She knew everything that was going to happen… everything that HAD to happen. Mother was a Giant.  The last “guardian” in Midgard. I guess she’s couldn’t tell us… but now she wanted us to know. She wanted me to see I have a destiny, but I’m not really sure what it all means yet. Maybe we’ll head home now, or maybe we’ll see who else needs our help. I’m ready for whatever is next.

But that’s a worry for another day. For now I’ll keep training, and learning from father…. and he wants to go back out and help more people now! I think he’s still learning, too. This must be how Mom would have wanted it...

Complete
*20052*
A mighty Giant made of frost and stone. Looks like he had a huge fight with Aesir and Vanir gods. He battles Thor… and it looks like they both lose.
*20053*
“Hrungnir the Brawler”—a head of stone, but the mind of a child. Odin tricks him into getting drunk and rowdy in Asgard. Thor smashes his head, but he ends up crushed, and everybody laughs. Aesir are the worst.
*20054*
This one’s confusing. Ymir’s the first Giant, and things spring from his body… not just other Giants, but wind, trees, sun… maggots that turn into Dwarves maybe? Then Odin kills him… but where did he come from?
*20055*
So Ymir came from fire and ice, and all lands and creatures came from his flesh… including the Aesir, who then slew him to create “order” (in other words, to take control). The first Giant was Odin’s first victim…
*20056*
Hrungnir
*20083*
Ymir
*20084*
Thamur
*20085*
The greatest stone mason and one of the biggest Giants of all. He argues with his son Hrimthur, strikes him, and gets lost looking for him. Thor chisels Thamur in the head and crushes a whole town!
*20086*
Thamur was building a wall around Jötunheim to protect Giants from the Aesir. Did it ever get finished?
*20087*
Wolf-Giants! Sköll chases the Sun and Hati the Moon. What happens when they catch their prey? Looks like a massive fight—Odin, Thor, the World Serpent… could it be…?
*20088*
Sköll and Hati
*20089*
Ragnarök! Odin knows the prophecy and sent them anyway, cause Mimir says he’s always trying to control everything. Until then, they’re the “Bringers of Day and Night” that keep the Sun and Moon moving.
*20090*
A legendary Giant huntress—one of Mother’s favourites. She could hunt birds, boars, deer, anything! Her father taught her how… but what happened to him…?
*20091*
Skaði
*20092*
Her father Thiazi could take the form of any creature. Odin got jealous and tricked Skaði into hunting an eagle that was Thiazi in disguise! Is she still out there somewhere, under the frozen mountains?
*20093*
Bergelmir
*20094*
A Giant King with many, MANY children. Looks like he arrived on a sea of blood, and when he died he left a sea of tears. Dead, but not murdered (for once).
*20095*
Bergelmir and his queen survived the flood of Ymir’s blood, and founded Jötunheim. They did NOT seek revenge, except to live and see his kind prosper. “Bergelmir the Beloved”—a happy ending!
*20096*
Gróa
*20097*
A Giant Sorceress, and a powerful seer. Slain by Odin… did he steal her book of visions?
*20098*
Called “The Knowledge Keeper”, Gróa was the first to have a vision of Ragnarök. She trusted Odin as a friend. BAD IDEA.
*20099*
Jörmungandr
*20100*
The World Serpent spans all the waters of Midgard… maybe the only one big enough to beat Thor? I still can’t believe we met him!
*20101*
Now that I’ve heard Mimir talk to Jörmungandr in his ancient tongue, I wonder if I could figure out how to do it…
*20102*
Odin plotted to destroy Starkaðr after hearing Mimir praise him as a potential leader of Giants. They spread rumours and gathered a mob, and when he surrendered to clear his name, Thor murdered him.
*20103*
A Giant with eight arms, swinging four swords… until Thor chopped him up. Why did the gods gang up on him?
*20104*
Starkaðr
*20105*
Surtr
*20106*
An ancient Fire Giant of Muspelheim. He forged a sword of fire, and fought—or will fight—Thor and Odin.
*20107*
Prophecy says “Surtr the Brave” will die at Ragnarök but take Asgard with him. Mimir says it’s part of a grand cycle of death and rebirth, and Surtr accepts his fate.

*21381*

*21382*
This does not look good...
*21391*
Defeat Baldur
*21392*
We got Mimir’s eye back, but Baldur attacked Jörmungandr and he spat us out near the dead Stone Mason. Now Freya’s here and Baldur’s in a rage and everyone’s having it out. I don’t think we’re all walking away from this...
*21393*
Return to Týr's travel room
*21394*
Return to Sindri
*21395*
It’s over now. The spell on Baldur was broken by the mistletoe arrow holding up my quiver (of all things)! Freya brought back Thamur the Stone Mason to stop us, but Jörmungandr helped us beat him. We beat Baldur together, and we would have let him go, but he tried to kill Freya… and I guess she was alright with that, but we weren’t. Now he’s dead, and she’s really angry, and I don’t know how to feel about any of it. But one thing’s for sure: we’re going to Jötunheim!
*21396*
We sealed the three realm tears in Niflheim, and boy, it was not easy. I don't think Sindri will believe us, but I can't wait to tell him.

"From darkness keep safe the Light"\n\nMore like trying to keep the other Elves from getting it…
*25609*
"Until gods grow good"\n\nI guess he means never. But maybe...
*25610*
"Leave them in peace"\n\nA message from Týr? Does he mean the Giants?
*25640*
"Duraþrór"\n\nA stag of the World Tree who watches the gates of Jötunheim (where Giants come from). This really *is* the Giants' mountain!
*25641*
"Ignite"
I was able to light this "Brazier" by reading the runes. Some kind of spell, maybe? I bet there are more of these around the Lake of Nine. Were there more people here, before this was a lake? Where did they all go? So many questions... I wish we could ask the World Serpent!
*25642*
“To Njörd we offer back the sea’s bounty.”\n\nFor a god, Njörd doesn't sound too bad.
*25643*
"Death Inside"
This must be old. There's plenty of death outside, too.
*25644*
"Hræzlyr"\n\nWho or what would be named "terror"...?
*25645*
"Muspelheim"\n"Gauntlet of Surtr"\n\nThe ancient realm of fire! Now that we have the travel rune, we can go anytime and see what new challenges await.
*25647*
"Thought is faster than wind"\n\nTýr's testing our minds in here...
*25652*
“Hunting Death”
Hmm... Does this mean someone died during a hunt, or they were LITERALLY hunting Death? Sounds rough either way.
*25654*
“Don't wake him”\n\nI'm REALLY getting tired of being told what to do.
*25662*
"Njörd was here"\n\nTrying to imagine Mimir drinking with a Vanir god. Actually not that hard. I wonder if Freya was ever here…
*25663*
"Trade Grounds"\n\nFound what used to be a marketplace where Gods and Giants would meet and trade. Must have been before the war...
*25699*
“Death to the Raven God, Lord of the Hanged”\n\nShe really doesn't like Odin very much.
*25704*
"Welcome Jötnar"\n\nThe Jötnar had a settlement here? Giants, so close to home! But... how long ago?"
*25707*
“Turn back, Aesir.”\n\nI hope those are magic runes... words won't keep the Aesir away.
*25708*
I guess Ymir lived a long time ago. Wonder what happened to them…
*25709*
"Jötnar only
and also Dwarves"\n\nThe Mountain was a stronghold of the Giants in Midgard. After they left, the Dwarves mined it dry.
*25710*
“The eternal war for the Light endures”\n\nThe same Light we need for the Bifröst, of course.
*25715*
"Niflheim"\n"Fog and Fortune"\n\nA misty realm of treasure and traps! Well, we have the rune to go explore...
*25716*

Finder's Fee

*31072*
"Through this path lies the Mines of Völunder. This great endeavour was made possible by Andvari the Alchemist, Son of Ivaldi, through whose ingenuity the very stone and bedrock was turned from obstacle to mighty tool of industry. A Dwarven Miner's greatest fear has always been running afoul of The Ancients, but through Andvari's genius, they are now no more than tools in our righteous undertaking. A new age for Dwarves dawns here—no mere miners but masters of iron, whose greatest craft is the future itself!"
*31132*
To See Her Again
*31156*
"The death of my daughter turned me into a broken man, but one of the Lake Spirits tells me I can find some peace. His master's a powerful seiðr witch, and he says she'll reunite me with my sweet Iona! I just need to find her bones. Don't know why someone would go to the trouble a scatterin' bones across the Lake of Nine, but the task is naught to me. I'd go to Helheim for a chance to see my daughter again."
*31162*
Death to the Gods
*31163*
"I was foolish to think a simple apprentice could survive on his own out in these harsh lands. My supplies dwindle, and the Draugr are more numerous than I had anticipated. But my parents deserve vengeance, and I will not rest until they have it. They only wanted to honour the gods, and died with nothing to show for it. The gods... they are not wise. They are not just or good. They are not to be worshipped or idolised. They are no better than man. I pray for their deaths.
I realise the irony. Who am I praying to? What god answers the prayer of 'death to the gods'? And still, I pray for one who would purify this world of their evil and send them to the same Hel that awaits the rest of us."
*31164*
Shipwrecked
*31643*
"Until today, I've always thought the Lake of Nine as a desolate, cursed place. And for the three ships caught in the recent storm, that notion holds true. But for this simple scavenger? Their loss is my gain. I found their fool of a captain on one of the beaches. He was a broken man, in both spirit and body.  I gave him Hel's kindness, but not before I filled my pockets with all the hacksilver I could carry.
The captain held an Offering to Týr, which is all well and good... But to neglect Thor? What kind of experienced seafarer neglects the God of Thunder?"

The icy bodies of re-animated Reavers (commonly known as 'Hel-Walkers') remain a mystery—what causes their resurrection? Finally, the various spirits throughout the Lake of Nine. They appear harmless... which is more than can be said of the Draugr and Hel-Walkers. The ones I've encountered show a single-minded determination in some task or desire that keeps them bound to this realm. What will happen to them should they achieve their goal? All have offered some form of reward. Speaking with these spirits can be unsettling, but perhaps their requests bear further consideration?"

Draugr
*34931*
Mother said that Draugr were warriors who died, but their souls were too stubborn and angry to stop fighting. They’d fight off the Valkyrie that came to collect them, and bring their own dead bodies back to life… warping and twisting their previous form into something else. Now they’re husks of their former selves, and fight anybody they can find. She also said they can come back in all different shapes and sizes and that some even have powers that others may not.
*34932*
Heavy Draugr
*34933*
These Draugr seem bigger than the ones we first encountered. They carry heavier, more dangerous weapons. It makes them slower, but they're a LOT stronger than the regular ones.
*34934*
Draugr (Shield)
*34935*
I already knew that Draugr weren't just mindless monsters, but I didn't think they were smart enough to use a shield. They like using it, too. We'll have to change up our strategy a bit and see where we can find an opening.
*34936*
Draugr (Dual Wield)
*34937*
A Draugr with two weapons is twice as dangerous, right? When they're with a more defensive enemy, we should consider taking down these dual-wielding Draugr early in the fight and not turn our back on them.
*34938*
Draugr (Projectile)
*34939*
These Draugr can shoot fireballs. How do they do that? They like to attack from a distance, which can be really annoying when we're fighting a bunch of other enemies, but luckily they go down pretty quickly.
*34940*
Draugr (Speed)
*34941*
What's more terrifying than a Draugr? A Draugr that can run at you really fast. Mother said some Draugr had special powers, and these ones are able to shoot fire out of their legs and move quickly around the battlefield. We'll need to be on our toes.
*34942*
Draugr (Explosive)
*34943*
I'm not sure how they do it, but these Draugr store energy in their bodies, and then explode on contact. But the explosion doesn't hurt them at all! I wonder if it feels good to them? Anyways, we should attack from a distance when we see that they are fully charged up.
*34944*
Draugr (Power Weapon)
*34945*
As if the undead trying to kill us with sharp objects wasn't bad enough, some Draugr can channel energy through their arms, charging their weapons and making them even more dangerous. Getting hit with a rusty old sword hurts, but getting hit with a fire-charged sword hurts worse.
*34946*
It takes a beat for him to recover after swinging, if we dodge, he'll be open to a counter-attack.
*34947*
His attacks are so strong, it makes blocking them really hard. Father should probably just dodge them.
*34948*
Swinging wildly won't break his guard, but if Father uses his Block Break, he should be able to find an opening (Double Tap [BlockButton]).
*34949*
Parrying his attacks can also break his guard.
*34950*
These Draugr really know how to use their weapons. We need to be ready for several attacks at once.
*34951*
With two weapons they like to combo their attacks, but we can disrupt their flow by parrying their attacks.
*34952*
They can attack from long range, but we should be safe if we dodge or block.
*34953*
These speedy enemies can be hard to hit. Father should wait for them to rush him and parry their attacks.
*34954*
I see them stomp their feet right before they charge. Should help us spot their incoming attacks.
*34955*
We should avoid hitting them with melee attacks when they’re powered up, we’ll be knocked back by an explosion.
*34956*
Father should throw his axe at them when they’re powered up. They'll explode and damage all nearby enemies.
*34957*
They power up their weapon and attack with a forward moving shockwave.
*34958*
They have a strong attack, but if we dodge to the side we should be okay.
*34959*
Revenant (Poison)
*34960*
Mother once told me that some witches trade little bits of their soul here and there to become more powerful in Seiðr magic. Eventually, they lose every part of their humanity and become Revenants. They can disappear in an instant, and these particular Revenants are able to spread poison through touch and breath.
*34961*
Revenant (Summoner)
*34962*
This kind of Revenant can actually summon Nightmares. Does she create them with her Seiðr magic, or are they all just squeezed together in her pack? I wonder how so many of them fit in that little pack.

Tatzelwurm
*34968*
A Tatzelwurm is part lizard, part cat—a Lizard-Cat! Or a Cat-Lizard… or something. Either way, the combination is pretty weird. They like to burrow underground to close the distance between them and their prey. Their claws and teeth are extremely sharp, but it’s that poisonous barb on their tails that we really need to watch out for.
*34969*
Cursed Tatzelwurm
*34970*
This Tatzelwurm doesn't have the poisonous barb, but it does have a sac in its throat that lets it barf poison at us. I know; it's really gross. The poison is deadly to the touch, so even if we dodge the attack, we still need to be careful not to step in it.
*34971*

*34979*
Dark Elf Lord
*34980*
I've always admired wolves, but the ones we've encountered attack us on sight, which means they're probably rabid. I guess to them, we are food. I know it's kill or be killed, but still... they're beautiful in their own way, and killing them makes me a little sad. Good thing Father probably won't read this.
*34981*
We've seen a lot of aggressive wolves, but these are something else... some other kind of disease. They spit out some kind of poison that we should avoid walking in, and they're even more aggressive than the rabid ones. I bet we would be doing them a favour by putting them out of their misery.
*34982*
These things are a complete mystery. They always show up in groups, but at least they go down fairly easily. They don't have weapons, but they can grow their limbs into sharp points that are just as dangerous. They also tend to try and latch onto Father, and use their greater numbers to overwhelm us.
*34983*
These faceless creatures are very aggressive and don't hesitate to run straight at us. They clearly have the same kind of ice powers we see from anything that comes from Hel. They fall very easily to Father's Blades.
*34984*
Unlike the Light Elves of Alfheim, the Dark Elves prefer dark places. Maybe that’s why they want to cover up the Light? They can fly and seem pretty smart and well-coordinated; more so than most of the enemies we’ve fought so far. Their weapons are useful; effective up close and at a distance. Kind of like Father’s axe!
*34985*
This type seems stronger than the average Dark Elf. They swing their heavy weapons so hard it creates a shock wave, making their attacks really tough to dodge.
*34986*
This one is able to call in reinforcements, so we should take him down quickly. They should be easy to spot, thanks to the bright glow in their wings. I wonder how many Dark Elves there are in Alfheim?
*34987*
Bigger, faster, and stronger than any Dark Elf we've fought so far. Their attacks are so strong they can blind and deafen us for a bit. They fight a lot like regular Dark Elves, just WAY harder.
*34988*
A World Serpent Scale
*34989*
The Dwarves can take fragments of the World Serpent's old scales and form a fresh scale.
*34990*
100 World Serpent Scale Fragments
*34991*
The Dwarves can break apart a scale of the World Serpent to form smaller fragments.
*34992*
Dauði Kaupmaðr
*34993*
I think the troll we just fought was Dauði Kaupmaðr. Mother used to always tell me stories about him to try and scare me if I wandered off too far. I think she’d be proud of me, but Father thinks because I got a little angry that I’m “not ready.” Whatever. I just helped him kill a troll; I know I’m ready!
Mother told me a lot of stories about trolls. This one’s name translates to Death Merchant. With a name like that, I think it’s safe to assume he was pretty evil. I’m glad we killed him.
*34994*
Nightmare
*34995*
Mom used to tell me stories about Nightmares until, well... I started having nightmares. I was embarrassed, but she said they were just another part of life, and that sometimes there was "beauty in the horror." She always saw the upside to everything, even these creepy little floating eye monsters. They're named after an older creature, called a Mare, that sits on your chest while you sleep and feeds off your fear.
*34996*
Nightmare Parasite
*34997*
As if Nightmares weren't annoying enough, it looks like this type can actually possess other creatures and make them stronger.  Does the possessed creature have any control over their actions, or are they just trapped in some horrific waking nightmare?  Not a very nice thought.
*34998*
Ogre
*34999*
Giant, powerful, angry, but thankfully not very smart. The Ogre is one of the ugliest enemies we've fought. Their huge arms give their attacks good range, and they can hit the ground so hard it creates powerful shock waves.
*35000*
Fierce Ogre
*35001*
These Ogres are similar in size to the regular ones, but they can cover long distances with a single jump. And... they smell REALLY bad. I wonder if that's why they're so angry all the time?
*35002*
Ice Nightmare
*35003*
These Nightmare can use the same power of frost  that we've seen the Hel-Walkers use. These attacks will slow us down if they manage to hit.
*35004*
Hel-Revenant
*35005*
Like the other Hel-Walkers, the Hel-Revenant attacks with ice that can slow us down. Mother used to tell me bedtime stories about the Revenants, but she never mentioned this kind. Maybe she thought it was too scary for me.

Return to the boat
*35097*
Find a different exit
*35098*
We found the son of the Reaver Spirit we met back at Fafnir's storeroom. Looks like the son's mutiny led to another mutiny in the end. I guess he had it coming… but it's still a little sad. Back to the boat now, to bring Sindri his whetstone.
*35099*
The water wheel that we freed earlier is blocking the way we came in. We'll have to find a back door. I noticed a grate near the ship, I bet we can open it and get out that way.

Stonebeard King
*35109*
Mother said Stonebeard King earned his title "King" simply because no one could take it from him. If you are arrogant enough to call yourself a king, you better be able to back it up, and Stonebeard could.  He never lost a fight... until now.
*35110*
Grendel of the Frost
*35111*
Grendel of the Frost was the stuff of legend. Even Mother thought he was just a myth. It was said that Grendel was the strongest and most feared among the Stone Troll Tribe. They hold the name "The Frost" in the highest regard, and only give it to someone who is to be honoured and revered. And now he's dead. Serves him right for trying to kill us!
*35113*
Death Eater
*35115*
Mother never mentioned this troll. Guess he never did anything special to earn an interesting bedtime story. And now he never will.
*35116*
Máttugr Helson
*35117*
Máttugr Helson, known as Helheim’s son and bridge keeper. Apparently, he was actually born and raised in Hel. Growing up in a troll tribe can’t be an easy life, but growing up in Hel must be even worse.
*35118*

Fire Nightmare
*35222*
These Nightmares shoot fireballs. As if we needed MORE reasons to hate Nightmares.
*35223*
Exploding Nightmare
*35224*
These Nightmares like to swarm in close and then explode. Why do they sacrifice themselves like this? Maybe they are all part of some kind of hive mind. Whatever the reason, it's really annoying.
*35225*
Wolves typically hunt in packs and will try to surround their prey. Father should try to keep them in front of him and let me help draw their attention.
*35226*
When these wolves howl, we should be ready for a strong attack.
*35227*
We'll have to be extra careful not to step in the stuff they vomit up. It's poisonous. Smells real bad, too.
*35228*
The poison from these wolves makes attacking up close risky. My bow and Father's axe throw is a safer way to take them down.
*35229*
Using the [HeavyAttackButton] axe throw will freeze them and bring them down to earth.
*35230*
My arrows can stun them which will allow Father to finish them off. If he grabs them when stunned, he can throw them at other enemies and they’ll explode!
*35231*
As soon as they start charging us, just one hit to their body will blow them up. The explosion hurts other enemies, too! Could be useful when fighting a big group.
*35232*
If they get too close to us, they'll explode. We need to hit them at range.
*35234*
Brenna Dauði
*35235*
Dauði Munr
*35236*
Grendel of the Ashes
*35237*
Seiðr Reavers are able to heal, so if we start attacking one, we should try to finish the job quickly.
*35238*
When they die, they detonate in a poison cloud. If we're too close, we should try to dodge away.
*35241*
They only attack after they've conjured an explosive Seiðr magic spell. We should rush them down before they can throw it, or try and dodge.
*35242*
If they do create their bomb, Father can disrupt them by throwing his axe before they have time to throw it.
*35243*
We should kill these guys quickly, they're able to heal from most wounds.
*35244*
We should watch out when they power up their weapon with Seiðr magic. They can do a powerful triple slam attack.
*35245*
He is slow but very sturdy. We should dodge his horizontal swings backwards and his vertical swings sideways and attack him in the time it takes to recover.
*35246*
The Traveller has a magical rune. If we see him lift it in his hand, Father should throw his axe at it.
*35247*
These Travellers must be a paranoid bunch, because they keep a huge shield on their back that will deflect any attempt to back stab him.
*35248*
We'll have to watch for him to turn and attack before striking him from the front.
*35249*
These Nightmares come after me and try to take me out of the fight, but Father can stop them. Hopefully he will...
*35250*
We can either dodge their shots, or interrupt them with an arrow or axe throw. The stronger ones can shoot faster.
*35251*
These Nightmares try their hardest to possess other enemies, making those enemies a lot stronger.
*35252*
If we stun or kill a possessed enemy, it will force the possessing Nightmare out of their body.
*35253*
They can poison us, and we need to be extra careful of their leaping attack.
*35254*
The Brood explode when they die. We can use this to damage and knock away any nearby enemies.
*35255*
Her pestilence powder leaves poison hazards in the environment. If Father steps in them, he'll be damaged and poisoned.
*35256*
Her fissure attack can move around obstacles to hit us. Father has a better chance of dodging if he waits until it's closer.
*35257*
She tries to summon Nightmares often, so we need to make sure we interrupt her to avoid being overrun by them.
*35258*
Her powder smokescreen clouds can blind us, and they provide cover for her follow-up attacks. We should avoid them as much as we possibly can.
*35259*
When Father throws his axe at a Tatzelwurm as it burrows towards him, it'll pop them out of the ground.
*35260*
Launching and attacking Tatzelwurms as they dig into the ground will stop them from burrowing for a short time.
*35261*
Their spit is highly poisonous, even on the ground. Throwing the axe with [R2] will freeze them and keep them from burrowing underground.
*35262*
Attacks that slam the ground can pop nearby Tatzelwurm out of their burrows.
*35263*
This Ogre has a very quick tell before he attacks. Father can use that to get out of the way.
*35264*
Father is strong enough to block one of his attacks, but it takes some time for him to recover. Smarter to avoid it altogether.
*35265*
If Father can goad an Ogre into using their jump smash, it'll take them a couple of moments to recover if they miss. I just hope they miss.
*35266*
Getting behind an Ogre is a good opportunity for Father to do some damage. But if they turn and see him, they'll definitely attack.
*35267*
A Wulver's howl is a sign they are going into a frenzy where they can attack with incredible speed.
*35268*
If Father finds himself caught in the Wulver's frenzy attack, I may be able to draw the Wulver's attention with a well placed arrow.
*35269*
When a Wulver crouches on all fours, they become very difficult to hit. We need to be on our guard and not leave ourselves open to counter attack.
*35270*
The other Wulver gets a lot faster after it starts howling. This one seems to get a lot stronger. We should be really, really careful after this one starts howling.
*35273*
These enemies become enraged and super aggressive when you’re frosted. Father should do his best to avoid their frost blast attack.
*35274*
If these things do manage to freeze us, we should stay on the defensive until it passes.
*35275*
Hel-Walkers with shields can block just about anything. Father can his Block Break skill to break their guard.
*35276*
Father should throw his axe at their feet to get around their shields and trip them up.
*35277*
These enemies will deflect Father’s frost axe attacks. He’ll have to use his fists instead to stun them.
*35278*
Hel-Walkers seem to draw their power from the frost, which makes Father's axe pretty weak against them. Good thing he's strong with his fists, too. I wish we had a fire weapon.
*35279*
Their projectiles are quick but don’t stun us. If we rush them, we can take them out of the equation early.
*35280*
I should be able to help Father with these enemies. Just like their projectiles disrupt his movements, my bow can disrupt theirs.
*35281*
They can cast an ice wall as cover. Father can throw the axe when they pop up behind cover, or throw it past them and recall it to hit them from behind.
*35282*
Their ice walls do more than just provide cover: if we get too close, they can detonate it. We should try to deal with them from range.
*35283*
Father can dodge his mace depending on the type of swing. Looks like it's best to dodge horizontal swings backwards, and the vertical swings sideways.
*35284*
If he misses his overhead attack, his mace gets stuck in the ground and he's open for an attack.
*35285*
The Undead Travellers are more aggressive than the regular ones. Ranged attacks are tricky, because he sprints right at us.
*35286*
We can whittle down his armour if we stay close and dodge his strikes. But when he charges up his sword for an overhead strike, it's time to move!
*35287*
They'll look straight up before firing their ice projectile, so we should either get out of the way or hit them with Father's axe (or my arrows).
*35288*
When Father throws his axe at Nightmares, it knocks them closer to the ground. Then he can use melee attacks to finish them off.
*35289*
Their air slam attacks can leave us slowed. If they're up in the air, steer clear
*35290*
The Brood are extremely weak to Father’s Runic Attacks.
*35291*
Her icy fissure attacks damage and freeze Father. We'll have to avoid them if we want to be able to take her down.
*35292*
We can either interrupt, outrun, or dodge her ice-breath attack – it can freeze Father and leave him idle and vulnerable to attacks.
*35296*
Dark Elves like to attack as a group. When Father lands a heavy hit or parries, it tends to break the swarm.
*35297*
If we can freeze or weaken the Dark Elves, it will prevent them from using air recoveries when launched.
*35298*
We should watch out for their charge attacks. They can cause temporary blindness. It's hard to fight when you can't see anything!
*35299*
They are much easier to kill when grounded. Tripping them up seems to work pretty well.
*35300*
When he spins his weapon, it means he's about to call in more Dark Elves. We should stop him before he slams it into the ground.
*35301*
He can block axe throws, but if we catch him off guard, Father's heavy axe throw will freeze him and negate his speed.
*35302*
It's so strong and has thick armour, but leaves itself open after certain attacks.
*35303*
If we can freeze or weaken it, it won't be able to recover in the air when launched or knocked out of aerial attacks.
*35304*
Father can hit them twice on the same axe throw; once on the throw and again on the recall.
*35305*
These would make good target practice for me and my bow. A couple of arrows would probably bring them down.

Reaver
*36833*
These were just normal human Reavers once, but they look like they've been corrupted by Seiðr magic. When did this start happening?
*36834*
Shadow
*36835*
These were human Reavers, but now that they've embraced the ways of the Seiðr, they can throw magic spells at a distance.
*36836*
Viken
*36837*
These Seiðr Reavers like to use big maces when they fight. Mom always referred to them as "Vikens," for some reason.
*36838*
Traveller
*36839*
They wear really strong armour, have huge swords, and are one of the toughest enemies we've faced. Who are they, and what do they want with us? Mom never mentioned the Travellers. I hope we don't have to fight too many of them.
*36954*
Traveller Champion
*36955*
This Traveller has a huge shield on his back, which makes breaking through his extremely tough armour even tougher.
*36956*
Wulver
*36957*
They look like wolves, but they stand upright like humans and are a lot smarter. And stronger. And faster. Their fur is so dense, it makes them tough to put down. They remind me a little of those Berserkers that Father put down last summer… but wolves instead of bears.
*36958*
Fierce Wulver
*36959*
This looks like an even tougher breed of Wulver. They're smarter, too. Really, really dangerous creatures. Glad my bowstring has some magic in it, otherwise I'm not sure how we'd bring these stronger ones down.
*36960*
?????????
*36961*
What is this thing? It looked like a Reaver, but its voice sounds so strange… Even Father doesn’t know.
*36962*
Hel-Reaver Guard
*36963*
It's a Hel-Reaver, but it carries a shield and it knows how to use it. Guess they aren't completely mindless.
*36964*
Hel-Reaver Lord
*36965*
These must've been strong Reavers back when they were alive. Now that they're dead they are even stronger Hel-Reavers.
*36966*
Hel-Shadow Archer
*36967*
It's like one of the Shadows, but it uses Ice magic like a thrown spear. Must be one of the Hel-Walkers.
*36968*
Hel-Shadow Scout
*36969*
It acts like a Shadow, but uses ice magic instead of Seiðr magic. Definitely a Hel-Walker.
*36970*
Hel-Viken
*36971*
It's a Viken, but a dead one. So, a Hel-Viken? This Hel-Walker is just as strong as its Seiðr counterpart. Maybe even stronger.
*36972*
Hel-Traveller
*36973*
I didn't think the Travellers could get much worse, but it looks like death wasn't enough to keep this one down. In fact, it's even MORE aggressive than the other Travellers we've seen. I guess even Travellers can become Hel-Walkers.

We’re going back to the Lake of Nine to talk to the World Serpent again, since Mimir speaks his language. I wonder if I could learn it too?

We met this Dwarf on our way to the Mountain, and he’s a blacksmith. A famous blacksmith, apparently. He made the Leviathan Axe! He upgraded it for Father, too. He was a little rude and grouchy, but I kind of like him anyway. I hope we see him again!
*37129*
Sindri
*37130*
Sindri's also a famous blacksmith, but he and his brother are really different. Sindri REALLY doesn't like dirt and grime. Weird trait for a blacksmith dwarf, but he's just as talented as his brother. I wonder why they don't get along?
*37131*
Blightguard
*37132*
Andvari
*37133*
Low Perk activation chance to strike with an explosive curse that inflicts WEAKNESS to enemies on any successful hit.
*37134*
Andvari wasn’t very helpful at first, but something about seeing that dead Soul Eater in the Landsuther Mines made him realise he was being kind of a jerk. I think he feels guilty because he and some other Dwarves were experimenting with Ancients there, and they accidentally created Soul Eaters. Glad we didn’t have to fight any more.
Anyway, his soul is still trapped in a ring. Brok wanted to melt him down (he can be so mean sometimes!), but I convinced Father to keep him, and now he’s part of our group. Father even uses Andvari’s soul as an Enchantment sometimes. Must be hard being trapped in a piece of jewellery, but Andvari doesn’t complain TOO much. I’ve gotten pretty good at ignoring him.
*37135*
Motsògnir
*37136*
Grips of the Valkyrie
*37137*
The Dwarf King. One of the Sons of Ivaldi. He ruled over humans both in Veithurgard and Konùnsgard. He was a good king at first, but then he started having dreams about his people dying. For some reason, he thought forcing them to hunt deadly beasts was the way to save them. He captured three dragons to harvest their 'Fury', killed innocent people to harvest their 'Screams', and was then killed by those very same people when they returned as Hel-Walkers. That created 'Ultimate Sacrifice.' We can use these three ingredients to create some kind of legendary armour.
*37138*
Baldur
*37139*
Baldur... He's one of the Aesir. Odin's son, Thor's brother. He came to our house and fought Father and Father killed him. Or... so we thought. Supposedly he can't feel pain. And now he's hunting us with his nephews, but we don't know why.
*37140*
Low Perk activation chance on any successful Blades hit to grant Power of the Valkyrie, increasing [Icons:STRENGTH] STRENGTH and [Icons:RUNIC] RUNIC. (Stacks up to 3 times max.)
*37141*
Witch of the Woods
*37142*
We met a witch in the woods who knows the old magic! Turns out the magic boar is her friend. She was mad that I shot him at first, but we were able to save his life. She lives under a giant turtle creature (who's also her friend) and she seems really nice.
*37143*
Magni
*37144*

Modi
*37147*
Evasive Runic
*37148*
The younger son of Thor, and a relentless creep. He also can shoot lightning, and uses a mace and shield. He ran off after Father killed his brother, Magni, but I bet we haven’t seen the last of him. I’ll kill him next time I see him.

Otr
*37151*

Moderate Perk activation chance to grant a Blessing of [Icons:RUNIC] RUNIC on any successful last-second evade.
*37157*
Moderate Perk activation chance to grant a Gift of [Icons:DEFENSE] DEFENCE on any successful last-second evade.
*37158*
Mom once told me a story about Otr; he was a dwarf who could turn into an otter (which is how he got his name, I guess). Is this the same Otr? How did he become a dragon? I'd ask Father, but I know he doesn't care. It's when I have so many questions like this... that's when I miss Mother the most.
*37159*
Reginn
*37160*
Reginn was captured by the Dwarf King and forced to act as Sentry of Konùnsgard. He's not very good at it; there are monsters everywhere. I guess that's what happens when you force a dragon to stand guard against his will. The Dwarf King must've wanted to capture these dragons for a different purpose...
*37161*
Fafnir
*37162*
Fafnir was a Dwarf. One of the Sons of Ivaldi, according to Mimir. But he was very greedy, and his greed turned him into a dragon. It sounds ridiculous, but I saw him with my own eyes... he was a dragon! I wonder if it was it painful to turn from dwarf to dragon? How long did it take? I had a bunch of questions for him, but he flew off before I could ask any.
*37163*
Gullveig
*37164*
A spirit convinced me that Gullveig, a powerful witch that was killed a long time ago, could “reunite” us with Mother. Father didn’t believe him. I shouldn’t have either… but for a chance to see Mom again, it seemed like we should give it a try, right?
Once we collected all her bones, Gullveig was resurrected, and said she’d reunite us, “In death!” And then attacked us. We killed her, obviously. I was really upset with myself. How could I fall for such an obvious lie? But Father said to “take it as a lesson,” so that’s what I’m gonna do. No more trusting spirits.
*37165*

Gunnr
*37168*
Mimir said of Gunnr:  "Mistress of War. After any conflict, big or small, she would be first on the scene, sussing out the worthy spirits for a free trip to Valhalla. A gruesome task, but she took great pride in it. Her judgement of the fallen was unparalleled, and an invaluable resource to Odin. She was one of his favourites."
*37169*
Geirdriful
*37170*
Mimir said of Geirdriful:  "Master of Arms in Valhalla. Responsible for arming and training Odin’s einherjar. His army, come Ragnarök. The einherjar wait in the great hall, endlessly feasting, drinking and fu— ahem uh… fornicating themselves silly. Once Ragnarök begins, Odin calls them into service to fight on his behalf. Geirdriful had her hands full, training that lot."
*37171*
Eir
*37172*
Mimir said of Eir:  "The Healer. Strange, for a Valkyrie. Very quiet. Very calm. Where her sisters were violent rapids, Eir was a gentle stream. She healed the wounds of both mortals and gods… and even a certain all-knowing sage who once drank too much and fell off a mountain."
*37173*
Prayer to Odin
*37174*
Beware of Seiðr
*37175*
"Find here our sacrifice, mighty Allfather, and deliver Midgard from Hel's wild hunt. Odin, wisest of all, whose breath gave life to Ask and Embla, first among our people, we beg your protection. Send forth your noble Valkyries and cull the deathless. Send forth your noble sons, Thor and Baldur, to shield us. Send forth dragons to consume the frigid horde. Save our souls that we may serve you evermore."\n\nI don't think Odin got the message. Or he didn’t care...
*37176*
"Beware of Seiðr and those who practise it! Their sorcery is insidious and ever-changing, and so are the souls who master it. The more power they summon, the less they are themselves."\n\nIs that how they turn into Revenants?
*37177*
The Light of Alfheim
*37178*
"From the light we are born, and to light we return. The light is the river of souls, transforming us, consuming us, transcending life and death. The light is the truth. The light is all."\n\nOKAY! The light sounds great but maybe it also makes you crazy?
*37179*
The Great Mountain
*37180*
“When the mountain was cold, it was Meløða and Ǫnþreis who gave it life. Wandering souls from distant lands, who had tasted of the Mead of Poetry and in search of inspiration found each other—and in each other, found great love. To the summit of Midgard’s great mountain, a secret bridge was built. Here they would make their hearth and fortress—to live free of prophecy, and know only themselves and each other. The mountain became a shelter for the outcast and the artist, for Jötnar and new friends made. And to this beacon many more souls made pilgrimage. Even as now we shelter from the storm, let none forget the beckoning spirit of the mountain that was.”\n\nSounds like the mountain used to be pretty amazing… Mom always did love artists.
*37181*
Rites of Fjörgyn
*37182*
"Here we bear witness to the funeral rites of Fjörgyn of the Jötnar, goddess of the earth and trees. For her beauty she was seduced, for her love she was betrayed, and for her gift of life, her life was claimed. To the summit and across the bridge she shall be borne, where nevermore the Thunder may find her."\n\nDid Thor kill his own mother?! Was that the first Giant he killed? What does it mean??
*37183*
The Long, Cruel War
*37184*
"Here fell Nerthus of the Vanir, slain by Magni and Modi, sons of Thor. The Jötnar bear witness to the cruelty of this Long War. Neither Aesir nor Vanir may triumph, it is foreseen -- but what may be left of Midgard before they lay down arms?"\n\nThe Giants wanted peace... no wonder they liked Týr so much...
*37185*
Prayer to Frigg
*37186*
“Hail Frigg! Generous Frigg, who gave the world her brightest light -- young Baldur, gleaming god, pride of the Aesir, Odin-Son and heir to Asgard. Long may she protect him. Long may he protect us. Hail Baldur the Golden. Hail Frigg, beloved of all! Hail Odin Allfather!”\n\nSeems like nobody who counted on the Aesir is still around…
*37187*
Motsògnir’s Throne
*37188*
"After many winters, the Stronghold of Konùnsgard is complete! Motsògnir has invited all citizens to attend the grand ceremony in the throne room. There we await the calming words of our King, who promises everlasting safety and prosperity.
This new land is even more fertile than Veithurgard. And with Reginn as our stalwart sentry, we fear naught from the Reaver, Dark Elf, nor any malevolent force! The reign of King Motsògnir is truly blessed by Týr himself! All Hail the Dwarf King, Protector of Man!"
Huh, sounds like they actually liked this Dwarf King. The people in Veithurgard sure didn’t… I wonder what changed?
*37189*
Reginn of Konùnsgard
*37190*
"Much like Otr of Veithurgard, Reginn has been conscripted as Head Sentry of Konùnsgard. Though he may occasionally struggle against his bindings, he takes great pride in his task. His thunderous breath, while extraordinarily dangerous, is merely his way of expressing pride. However, do take caution during weekly maintenance of the Dragon Shrines; Reginn will attempt to use his breath on you. This is not meant as an attack; it is merely his own cheeky way of passing the time. But make sure you vacate the area immediately, because it will kill you.
All rumours that Reginn’s presence attracts the Dark Elves of Alfheim is pure fiction. King Mótsognir will protect us from all beasts, as he has done time and time again."
Yeah… I don’t believe any of this.
*37191*
Ruins of Veithurgard
*37192*
“Nothing remains of Veithurgard except the ruins of Motsògnir’s cruelty. The once fertile soil is barren, soaked with the blood of both hunters and the hunted. It was The 'Noble' Dwarf King himself who demanded the bloodshed. He who conscripted the gentle farmers of these lands into an army of ill-equipped hunters; he whose thirst for savage beasts produced a legion of widows.
The castle still stands for those foolish enough to scavenge, wherein dwells the deadliest of his quarry. Let caution guide you.”
Yikes… Doesn’t sound like a very nice place. Father will probably want to visit anyways to look for useful resources. He's gotten a little predictable, but I'm still having fun seeing new places with him.
*37193*
An Unbreakable Chain
*37194*
“Otr has escaped his binds yet again. Instead of flying off this time, he seeks revenge on his captors, and is determined to turn Veithurgard to ash. We seek shelter in the outlying caves where we’ve found sanctuary in the past.
Our King assures us his next chain will be unbreakable. If anyone can build an unbreakable chain, it’s Motsògnir. Architect of the great Stronghold of Konùnsgard! Leader of a glorious new age in Veithurgard!. All Hail the Dwarf King, Protector of Man!”
These people seem a little friendlier… for all the good it did them.
*37195*
Cost of the Hunt
*37196*
“Six Wolves – Two men. Lo do they call to me.
Thirteen Draugr – Nine men. Lo do they call to me.
Three Tatzelwurms – Six men. Lo do they call to me.
One Troll – One and forty men. Lo do they call to me.
One Dragon – Nine and ninety men. Lo do they call to me.”
Sounds like these people weren’t very good at hunting. Maybe they should’ve just stuck with deer and boar.
*37197*
The Gravedigger
*37198*
"While I throw dirt on the mangled citizens of Veithurgard, Motsògnir looks upon his newly caged beast with a gleeful fervour. I curse his name. The Dwarf King set the capture of Trolls and Dragons above the safety of his own followers. The same followers who served and revered him, hunted these monsters, and died, forgotten.
My attempt to free the beast failed, and Motsògnir's punishment was swift: I am banned from Konùnsgard. Demoted to town gravedigger. A fitting end for a once proud hunter, whose prey hastened the fall of Veithurgard."
—Berhtolt
*37199*
The Hunt for Death
*37200*
“We baited the beast with a stuck fawn. Her cries echoed on the morning breeze. It did not take long for Death’s Hammer to approach. The smell of burnt grass, the bleating of the dying fawn, the fear of imminent death… many could not hold their breakfast. When it stepped into the clearing, our attack was swift.
The vanguard died instantly, burned to ash. No time to react, the hunt continued as we led the enraged troll to the Lake of Nine. There we subdued it, but not before losing thirty more men.
Upon our return, King Mótsognir proclaimed a week of celebration. The festivities were sparsely attended, though not for lack of pride in the victory. The population of Veithurgard had just been reduced by a quarter. I fear this sad irony was lost on the Dwarf.”
—Berhtolt
*37201*
The Curse of Ivaldi
*37202*
"Turn back! Upon this place sits the curse of Ivaldi, whose talents threatened the gods of Asgard. The mists of Niflheim were made a weapon by my father's alchemy, and turned upon their creator. His skill as an inventor and craftsman were unrivalled... but it was his talent and genius which drew the ire of the Aesir in the first place. Therefore I, Motsògnir, renounce this place. I renounce dwarvenkind. I am off to seek refuge and self-imposed exile in Midgard. Those who do not flee this realm will join my father in the grave.”
—Motsògnir, Son of Ivaldi
*37212*
Completed
*37213*
Ivaldi's armour was the peak of Niflheim craftsmanship, but this set is small and has grown decrepit. Sindri may be able to make use of it.
*37214*
Anchor of Fog
*37215*
To hide his machinations from Odin, Ivaldi crafted devices that could pull anything from Niflheim back to its home. Use (with caution) to open Realm Tears in Niflheim.

Gondul
*37352*
Mimir said of Gondul: "The sight of Göndul always took my breath away. Göndul had a silver tongue, a sharp wit, and struck a figure so stunning, it literally drove men insane. Odin forbid her from setting foot in Midgard after a time, as insanity is not a welcome trait in Valhalla."
*37353*
Hildr
*37354*
Mimir said of Hildr:  "Mistress of Battle. She and Odin got on quite well, actually. Her and the other Valkyries… not so much. She would spend most of her time here in Midgard, observing discord between the living, and stirring some up herself from time to time. She lived for conflict. Some say she WAS conflict, personified. I wonder what will become of her, now that she’s free."
*37355*
Olrun
*37356*
Mimir said of Olrun:  "Once the daughter of a powerful chieftain, she fell defending him during a Reaver attack. Olrun was escorted to Valhalla, where she chose to devote her after-life to the pursuit of knowledge above all else. Quite unusual behaviour amongst the constant drinking and feasting of her fellow Valhallian-denizens. Odin saw a kindred spirit in Olrun’s single-minded pursuit of knowledge and appointed her as the Valkyrie’s resident historian."
*37357*
Kara
*37358*
Mimir said of Kara:  "Wild Storm personified. Calm and collected… Then the air would shift, and the fury of her storm would unleash. ’Twas beautiful, in a way, assuming you could find proper shelter. Her tears would cleanse the blood-soaked battlefields."
*37359*
Rota
*37360*
Mimir said of Rota:  "One of the Choosers of the Slain. Rota was the first to go mad after being imprisoned in a physical form. Sigrun stashed her in Helheim to keep her away from harming herself or others. Mostly others."
*37361*
Sigrun
*37362*
Mimir said of Sigrun:  "Queen of the Valkyries, although she does not appear to refer to herself as such. When Freya, the original Queen Valkyrie, lost her wings to Odin, Sigrun grudgingly took the position in her stead. Now she is free to reunite the Valkyries and attempt to stem the tide of the dead flowing into Midgard."
*37363*
The Soul Eaters
*37364*
"Removing an Ancient's soul and domesticating it as a beast of burden was surprisingly easy. They followed my every command, and appeared to possess no free will, sense of self-preservation, or even hunger. Well... not until it turned poor Lit into ashes. Not even his soul remained.
A lack of their own must be what drives them to immolate the souls of others. My 'Soul Eaters' are an abomination. Several were sent to Muspelheim at the request of Surtr; what he will use them for, I shudder to consider. Another to Mótsognir at Konùnsgard; that fool can burn for all I care.  My immediate concern is the Dwarves of the Völunder Mines.  I pray I'm not too late to undo my mistake."
—Andvari
*37365*
This is the second Troll we've seen so far. I had no idea they were so close to our house! They've never bothered us before... but I guess we never bothered them either. Mother said if I ever saw a Troll, I should run the other way. Guess she never said that to Father.
*37366*
We killed this one while trying to restore the Jötunheim Tower to the Lake of Nine in all the realms. When the doors opened to Muspelheim, I guess he wanted to see what was happening.  Why is every troll’s first and only instinct to attack?
*37367*
This must have been the other Grendel’s brother? Or maybe “The Ashes” is a different kind of title that the Fire Trolls use to honour their kind. There’s so much we don’t know about trolls… but I guess the most important thing to know is that they are all trying to kill us, so we have to kill them first. That’s what Father would say, anyways.

A Son's Regret
*37459*
"Dad,
While you were off hunting and pillaging, Granddad raised me. Taught and cared for me. I loved him—and you stabbed him in the back. I hated you. But time has a way of changing things.
The clan celebrated. They spat on his kind spirit; saw it as proof of weak leadership. And as much as I hate to admit it, the Hræzla Farmaðr thrived with you at the helm.
As a boy, I made an oath to the Nornir that I would avenge him. My skill with a blade grew, and you finally began to notice me. We grew closer. But the Nornir do not suffer broken oaths. Not even those made by a grieving child.
Their chest outside Fafnir's Storeroom... it reminded me of that oath. So the cycle of betrayal continues. You killed the only father I ever knew, but even now... I regret my actions, and am filled with remorse. Forgive me."

The Hræzla Farmaðr
*37751*
"To know the Hræzla Farmaðr is to know the brutal history of these lands. Before the Great Flood, before the Desolation, men lived peacefully in Midgard. The dead stayed dead, Draugr were a rarity, and the use of Seiðr magic was considered deeply shameful. The Hræzla Farmaðr is of the Old Ways; when a man’s worth is measured by how well he swings a blade. Strength—our highest virtue. These are harsh lands, and they are no place for the weak. The strong will prosper in life, and in death, join the ranks of the einherjar in Valhalla. The weak will scrape and suffer a meagre existence, joining the ranks of unworthy in the depths of Helheim. Such is the cycle of life, ’til Ragnarök comes."
Harsh. They sound about as friendly as a pack of Wulvers.

*37808*
First, it was a human Reaver. Then we killed it. It died in battle, so shouldn't the Valkyries have taken it to Valhalla? But they didn't... it just came back as something else.
Before she died, I overheard Mother telling Father that, "The Hel-Walkers were returning." Is this what she was talking about? People rising from the dead? Father doesn't seem to know (or care) much about it. Since this thing used to be a Reaver, I'll call them, "Hel-Reavers."

Soul Eater
*37867*
They look almost exactly like Ancients, but there's something... off about them. Mom always called the Soul Eaters, "Dangerous abominations." She never said a bad word about ANY living creature (even poisonous bugs!), so her saying that always stuck with me. I wish I could tell her Father and I killed one.
*37868*
Dark Soul Eater
*37869*
An Ancient whose soul has been removed by dark Dwarven magic. It's stronger than a regular Soul Eater, and even THOSE still terrify me.
*37870*
Frost Ancient
*37871*
We ran into a Frost Ancient on our way up the Mountain. Before this journey, I thought all the Ancients were made of fire and rock, but I guess it’s just the rock part they all share. This one must have originally been part of the Mountain itself. I bet it got tired of being a mountain, and one day just got up and walked away.
*37872*
Ice Ancient
*37873*
An Ancient in the ice and snow… I wonder if they have thoughts like we do? I can’t hear any. They don’t have mouths or ears… none that I can see, anyways. They’re mostly pretty peaceful, unless we attack first. I’d never say this to Father, but I wish we could just leave them alone.
*37874*
Stone Ancient
*37875*
One of the Ancients... I can't believe it! Did Mom know they were still alive? They're, well... ancient! Supposedly they're a part of Ymir himself, and they've been around since the beginning of time. I thought they were all in Midgard... I wonder why this one is in Alfheim?
*37876*
Forest Ancient
*37877*
We ran into an Ancient of the Forest on our way out of Fafnir's Storeroom. This one was walking around, instead of just hibernating like most of them do. Or maybe we woke it up while we were trying to get inside? These Ancients are kind of beautiful... I wish their hearts weren't so valuable.
*37878*
Fire Ancient
*37879*
I could feel the heat off this one from the boat. I guess now we know what happened to all these broken ships...
*37880*
Lava Ancient
*37881*
This Ancient has been underwater for a long time… How does it keep its fire? And why didn’t it seek higher ground?  Maybe it goes into a kind of hibernation when it’s underwater?

Járn Fótr
*37926*
Mother said this troll lived in the Heart of the Mountain with the Giants, but there was a falling out one day and they cast him out. Makes sense to me; I wouldn’t want to live with a troll. Guess he moved back in when they left.
*37927*
Dauði Hamarr
*37928*
We found Dauði Hamarr trapped in a cage in Veithurgard. The Dwarf King had managed to capture him somehow. Why was he in this cage? We could have just let him rot down there, but…. even for a troll, that felt too cruel.

A King's Last Words
*37973*
"Tragic that my failure becomes apparent as the life flows out of me. The gods came to me as I slept, and demanded retribution for my father’s actions in Niflheim. My people… they who entrusted me to keep them safe… every damned night, visions of them mangled by all manner of beast. Only I could protect them—and only through building the Dvegræðikr.  I captured every deadly beast I could find, and set to building myth.
The dreams were very clear about the first two ingredients: Dragons’ Fury and Screams of the Innocent. Though many were sacrificed capturing the dragons, and the innocents’ screams were far worse than I ever imagined, all of it was for the greater good.
Of the third ingredient, my dreams were vague. Ultimate Sacrifice is all they would say. I hoped that forfeiting my morality during this damned search would be enough. Now I see it was my own sacrifice that was required.
Like my father before me, I've been such a fool."

"I used to live for the hunt. The excitement of stalking prey gave me a new purpose in life, one far more rewarding than the simple joy of watching crops grow. Each hunt gave me newfound confidence, and as my skill grew, so too did my arrogance.
I downed a particularly savage Tatzelwurm on this last hunt. The beast nearly gored me several times, and my blood was hot after so many close calls. I stood over its lifeless body, too occupied with my triumph to notice its mate behind me—a mistake that cost me dearly.
As the poison works its way to my heart, I reflect on the path my life took after the Dwarf King landed in Veithurgard, and formed his army of hunters. He gave me new purpose in life, true… but I would trade it all to spend one more day with my family as a simple farmer."
*38163*
Land of Kings
*38164*
"Despite Otr’s presence, monsters continue to flood into Veithurgard. They poison our crops, maim our farmers, and make an already miserable existence all the more unbearable. But just as our situation reaches a breaking point, Motsògnir brings word of a safe haven; a new land he has dubbed Konùnsgard. 'A land of riches, free from strife and danger.' There he has promised to build us a great stronghold to shelter and protect us—though I cannot bring myself to fully trust his words. It was his irrational thirst for such monsters that brought them here to begin with! Nevertheless, it has been so long since we’ve known safety. Veithurgard was once a beautiful land. I pray to Sif that this new land of Konùnsgard is able to weather The Dwarf King’s greed."

"To my dearest Thorrin,
When I was your age, I used to dream of being a god, just like our beloved Thor. It’s the reason we’re a family of stone masons; your mother and I wanted to spend our days swinging a hammer! You'll learn, however, that dreams fade as you grow older. We’ll never join the Aesir in the halls of Asgard, but we can still use our skill to honour them.
Your mother and I have grand plans here in Veithurgard to build a statue of Odin’s favourite son. It will be our life’s greatest work, second only to bringing you into this world.
I've just completed a powerful pommel for my hammer and named it after one of Thor’s legendary goats, as it calls on the power of thunder itself. One day, when I am gone, it will keep you safe. When you hold it in your hands, let it be a reminder of all the joy that Thor has brought to our family."

The Dream of Midgard
*38188*
“Midgard was a dream of what could be if we shared, and collaborated. Jötnar, Aesir, Vanir, Elf, Dwarf, and mortals most of all. It was beautiful. But not everyone is capable of sharing. Some believe anything uncontrolled is savage, and threatening. And so we were mocked, and tricked, and used, and then slaughtered.\n\nOdin and his tribe were barred from our realm, but it was not enough. The wrath of Thor and his terrible hammer have thinned our number in Midgard to the brink of ruin. There is no option but to withdraw, while yet any live to do so.”\n\nOdin and Thor would have killed ALL the Giants if they could... and they got away with everything!
*38189*
The Guardian Returns
*38190*
“We foresee Midgard’s fate - overrun, a second Hel. Neither Odin nor his dead may reach Jötunheim. The ways must be shut. The serpent and the guardian remained. They alone shall keep our hope. When doom befalls the indestructible, only then shall the guardian return.\n\nUntil then, we await a better world - one without fear, without greed, without war. We wait for deliverance, and justice. We wait for a champion. We will wait for word that gods grow good.”\n\nHope that world gets here soon...

*38204*
Odin collects prophecies...tries to control fate by knowing the future. Maybe he thinks we'll pose a threat someday. Or at least he knows we're looking for a way to Jötunheim...
*38205*
Serpent's History
*38206*
Jörmungandr the World Serpent has already fought Thor in Ragnarök, and was knocked back in time to now. That, or Mimir is insane.
*38207*
Odin's interests in Jötunheim—he fears the Giants at Ragnarök, and wants their prophecies of the future. (Giants are the best at prophecy?) Ask Mimir later why they call Odin "Lord of the Hanged"...
*38208*
Odin and the Jötnar
*38209*
Flight of the Jötnar
*38210*
The Giants left Midgard to escape Thor's slaughter—most likely their work destroying the bridges to travel there. What did they do to make the Jötunheim tower in the lake disappear?
*38211*
Odin spent nine days dead, hanging from Yggdrasil, the World Tree, for the wisdom of life and death and destiny. He goes REALLY far to get what he wants..!
*38212*
The Hanged God
*38213*
Nothing Is Written
*38214*
Odin thinks he can beat fate and change Ragnarök, even though the Serpent’s already been through it. Father doesn’t think much of fate either—“another lie told by the gods”—so they have that in common…
*38215*
Father kept those blades hidden under the house. If his old life is such a burden, why’d he keep them around?
*38216*
Father's Blades
*38217*
Sigil of the Weapon
*38218*
Frigg and Freya
*38219*
“Frigg” was Freya all along?? Baldur’s mother, Odin’s wife… it’s so hard to imagine her with the Aesir gods… but I’ve seen it with my own eyes now!
*38220*
When the Giants trusted someone enough to help them travel the realms, they’d put bifrost crystals in their eyes. Týr had them, and so does Mimir.
*38221*
Mark of the Element
*38222*
Mimir's Sight
*38223*
Mimir on the Dead
*38224*
Even Mimir doesn’t know why there’s so many dead men walking around Midgard… but he suspects Odin’s meddling, and maybe the Valkyries.
*38225*
Brok and Sindri made Thor’s Hammer, Mjölnir. It made their reputation… but it also seems like they can’t live it down.
*38226*
Mjölnir the Hammer
*38227*
The Huldra Brothers
*38228*
Brok and Sindri are dwarves, but for some reason people call them the “Huldra Brothers” after the beautiful forest sprites. Apparently I’m too young to be told why.
*38229*
So Mom was “Laufey the Just”—she really was protecting people, before she had me. They even knew of her in Asgard! I’m so proud of her…
*38230*
Laufey The Just
*38231*
Freya's Spirit
*38232*
While we were in Jötunheim, Freya found Mimir to ask where Odin might have kept her Warrior Spirit. That’s a little scary.

"If you’re reading this: Go away. You don’t belong here. This is MY ravine. And don’t touch any of my stuff on your way out.
You’re still here? I told you to LEAVE. These are MY treasures, and you can’t have them. The best stuff is in my storeroom, anyways. But don’t even THINK about going there. That place is well-guarded, I made sure of that.
Just leave me be. I don’t need you; I don’t need anybody. Certainly not any of Ivaldi’s stupid sons warning me about the dangers of greed. I only need look in my newly-acquired Vanir Mirror to see what it does to my skin. But I don’t care. My treasure makes me feel safe, and it warms me from the inside, like the breath of a dragon.
Get lost."
—Fafnir

After shockwave attacks, Ogres are momentarily stationary and easy to attack while they recover.
*39591*
[[D:Jotunn00,Jotunn10:187::::::Combat]]
Beware of the Ogre's grab!
*39592*
[[D:Jotunn00,Jotunn10:187::::::Combat]]
Ogre boulder attacks cannot be blocked and should be dodged.
*39593*
[[D:Witch20,Witch10,Witch00:115::::::Combat]]
When surrounded by their protective magic, Revenants evade most attacks. Atreus’s arrows can remove this magic, leaving them temporarily vulnerable to all attacks.
*39594*
[[D:Witch20,Witch10,Witch00:115::::::Combat]]
Steer clear of hazards that Revenants create; they can damage Kratos and apply status effects.
*39595*
[[D:Witch20,Witch10,Witch00:115::::::Combat]]
Revenants are most dangerous when encountered with other enemies. Defeating them first can make the encounter easier to handle.
*39596*
[[D:Witch20,Witch10,Witch00:115::::::Combat]]
Block or dodge to the side to avoid Revenants' raking fissure attacks. The fissures will navigate obstacles and try to find you.
*39597*
[[D:Witch20,Witch10,Witch00:383::::::Combat]]
Avoid the Hel-Revenant’s ice breath attack by all means. This attack can freeze you, leaving you vulnerable to enemies.
*39598*
[[D:Wulver00:180::::::Combat]]
When a Wulver howls, they enter a frenzy and their attacks become more focused and dangerous. Try a more defensive approach, and wait for openings to attack.
*39599*
[[D:Wulver00:180::::::Combat]]
Wulver are aggressive and relentless. If they aren’t yet frenzied, try fighting back with an aggressive, relentless approach... it can be more effective than a defensive approach.
*39600*
[[D:Wulver00:180::::::Combat]]
Some Wulver attacks can be avoided, leaving them vulnerable. Try luring them into walls to STUN them.
*39601*
[[D:Wulver00:180::::::Combat]]
Parrying a Wulver’s melee swipes is an effective strategy and can be used to break their attack momentum.
*39602*
[[D:Wulver00:180::::::Combat]]
Beware frenzied Wulver that are stationary and down on all fours. They can lunge and grab Kratos, mauling him. Dodge this attack!
*39603*
[[D:Draugr00:267::::::Combat]]
Dual Wielding Draugr will attack quickly. Parry to break their combo.
*39604*
[[D:Draugr00:267::::::Combat]]
Draugr with leg energy are hard to hit. Wait for them to come to you and parry their attacks.
*39605*
[[D:Draugr00:267::::::Combat]]
When Draugr with chest energy are powered up, avoid hitting them or you’ll be knocked back by an explosion.
*39606*
[[D:Bandit00:120::::::Combat]]
Hel-Reavers become enraged and aggressive when you’re FROSTED. Avoid their FROST blast attack.
*39607*
[[D:Bandit00:130::::::Combat]]
After taking fatal damage, Reavers detonate in a POISON cloud. Dodge away!
*39608*
[[D:Brawler00:180::::::Combat]]
Be aware of how Vikens attack! Dodge backward on their horizontal swings, and sideways on their vertical swings.
*39609*
[[D:Brawler00:180::::::Combat]]
Kill Vikens quickly or they’ll regenerate Health.
*39610*
[[D:Traveler00:180::::::Combat]]
Dodge sideways when Travellers attack with overhead swings.
*39611*
[[D:Traveler00:180::::::Combat]]
A Traveller's shield is impenetrable. Attack them from the front.
*39612*
[[D:Traveler00:180::::::Combat]]
When Travellers hold their trophy above their heads, attack it with ranged attacks before it detonates.
*39613*
[[D:Troll20:430:440:::::Combat]]
Grendel of the Frost is weak against the Blades of Chaos.
*39614*
[[D:Troll20,Troll10,Troll00:65::::::Combat]]
Trolls can power up their arms and legs for Elemental attacks. These limbs are vulnerable to ranged attacks!
*39615*
[[D:EarthDragon00:280:290:::::Combat]]
Deal damage to Hræzlyr's claws to provoke his electric attacks.
*39616*
[[D:EarthDragon00:280:290:::::Combat]]
Hold [BlockButton] to block stomp waves.\nHold [JoystickL] and Press [EvadeButton] to dodge claw attacks.
*39617*
[[D:EarthDragon00:280:290:::::Combat]]
Vibrate Crystals explode with electric energy.\nWait until Hræzlyr is electrified to throw crystals.
*39618*
[[D:EarthDragon00:270:280:MOV_sg1_attDragonGrabClaw01::::Combat]]
Deal damage to Hræzlyr’s claws to release the lift.
*39620*
[[D::494:498:::Helheim Sky::Combat]]
Don’t let the fires go out on the Helheim Ship.
*39621*
[[D::494:498:::Helheim Sky::Combat]]
Multiple attacks from the Blades of Chaos are required to fully re-ignite the fires.
*39622*
[[D::494:498:::Helheim Sky::Combat]]
Atreus’s arrows can be used to interrupt enemies before they put out the fires.\nKeep the fires fully lit!
*39623*
Stranger
*39624*
A strange man covered in tattoos came to the house and attacked Father. It must’ve been some fight… everything’s broken! Father said I wasn’t ready earlier, but something about killing this stranger changed his mind, I guess. Who was he? What did he want with us? We’re nobodies.
*39625*
The Goddess Freya
*39626*
The Witch of the Woods was the goddess Freya the whole time! No wonder she’s so good at magic. Father got REALLY mad at her when he found out. He always tells me that gods are nothing but trouble, but Freya’s always been nice to us. Maybe not all gods are bad?

“Construction of the Helheim Library is complete. Our greatest clues and most significant artefacts have been moved here. The process of translating and compiling the reports of the Travellers is ongoing, but Hel’s slow pace should make quick work of it in Asgard. The only concern is outside these walls. As the numbers of the wayward dead increase, how long until our presence here is untenable?"

*40038*
“It is done. Asgard’s defences are impenetrable. All means of access have been cut off, save those in Odin’s power. The plague of the dead will not touch us, nor shall we fear any Vanir aggression. Word of this must reach noble Thor, for the time approaches for his part in the Allfather’s plan."
—The Raven Keeper
*40039*
Svartalfheim sealed
*40040*
“The realm of the dwarves is secured. For a promise of security from the rovers of Hel, they have made Asgard custodian to their borders. Now the Vanir will have no hope of Svartalfheim’s aid, thanks to Odin’s foresight. The Elves remain sufficiently distracted. All plans proceed."
—The Raven Keeper
*40041*
Vanaheim sealed
*40042*
“Our vengeance upon the Vanir gods is at hand. Their realm is isolated by Odin’s spell-craft, and infiltrated presently by the God of Thunder himself. Thor’s absence may be long-felt by our folk, but we will keep up the Allfather’s work in Midgard. Our priority remains Jötunheim."
—The Raven Keeper
*40043*
The Serpent
*40044*
“The Serpent cannot be spoken to, but his belligerence towards the Aesir is unmistakable. The destruction of Týr’s temple is infeasible while he remains; however, his presence has caused the Lake of Nine to submerge it completely. Therefore, the larger aim of fettering realm travel is still achieved."
—The Raven Keeper
*40045*
The Missing Tower
*40046*
"The search for any trace of the Jötunheim tower remains fruitless. Not only Midgard, but in all realms in which the tower once stood, there is now only a mystic echo of what was. Had it been destroyed by might, some remnant would remain, but this magical vestige suggests magical means. It must exist somewhere. Our horde of loyal spies continues to grow. I cannot doubt someday we will find it, wherever it may be hidden."

This is a strange language… I don’t recognise it at all. Maybe if we find more like it I can figure something out…

*40056*
Of course! It’s “Jötunheim”... it’s always about Jötunheim, and it always comes back to Odin pulling the strings. He has a whole army devoted to finding “The Lost Path”... and here we are trying to find it first.

*40065*
Revenge of Hrimthur
*40066*
The Aesir finally met their match with the Vanir, and the Long War only ended when Mimir convinced Freya to marry Odin.
*40067*
Did Odin love Freya? Mimir thought so, for a while... but once Odin learned her magic, his old obsession with Jötunheim led him down a dark path.
*40068*
When Freya finally left Odin, he cursed her, trapping her in Midgard and stealing her Warrior Spirit. Since she can't fight, she has to live alone in the woods for safety.
*40069*
Týr brought Odin to Jötunheim to make peace with the Giants, but Odin's deceptions were exposed and he was cursed to never return. As Thor slaughtered the Giants of Midgard, Týr helped the survivors escape, and cut off access to their realm.
*40070*
When Hrungnir the Brawler fell on Thor, only young Magni and Modi had the strength to free their father. Magni got the credit, so Modi became a jerk? (Nah, they were both jerks.)
*40071*
Mimir used to work for a faerie king in a faraway land, until he made too much mischief. He's been using his wits to survive for a long time...
*40072*
Mimir introduced himself to Odin with a "mystic well of knowledge" that made him rip out his own eye. Their relationship sounds complicated.
*40073*
After a long time advising Odin, Mimir came to believe he could only serve Odin by containing him and serving peace, but Odin lost trust in him and imprisoned him in the tree.
*40074*
Hrimthur, son of Thamur the Giant Stone Mason, disguised himself and built a wall around Asgard. Mimir thinks he built in a weakness and told only Freya about it.

“I’ve explored every beach, cavern and ravine in the Lake of Nine, save for beyond  this door. Behind it lies Konùnsgard, fabled stronghold of the Dwarven King, Mótsognir. Rumour has it he went mad while searching for some legendary armour. Unfortunately, the area is sealed by Dwarven ingenuity. If the ruins of Veithurgard are of any indication, there must be great treasure behind this door.  I sought out Brok and Sindri, the fabled blacksmith dwarves for their assistance, but they each want me to complete Favours for them in exchange for the entry stone. I’ve never completed a Favour for a dwarf before… how hard could it be?”
—Sounds like we need to do more Favours for Brok and Sindri if we want to get in here.

We found this strange man trapped in a tree at the summit of the Mountain. His name is Mimir, and he calls himself the Smartest Man Alive. Or he did, until Father chopped off his head. The witch of the woods (who was actually the goddess Freya this whole time!) was just able to resurrect him, and now we’re taking him to talk to the World Serpent. Mimir says Jörmungandr is the only Giant left in Midgard who knows the secret rune to Jötunheim. It’s kind of weird talking to a reanimated head, but it’s nice to have someone else to talk to.
*43223*
World Serpent
*43224*
We just woke up the World Serpent of Midgard! Father thought he was going to try and eat us, but Mother always said Jörmungandr was a friendly Giant. He tried speaking to us, but I couldn’t understand him. I wonder if that’s the language all the giants speak? He doesn’t seem very interested in us right now. I wish I could talk to him… I have so many questions! Where did he come from? What does he do all day? What does he eat? Maybe we can find another way to talk to him…

A Thief’s Testimony
*43820*
“To the next poor fool to find this place,
You’d be wiser to flee than to brave the dangers within… but count yourself lucky I came before you to unwittingly free the prior occupant, and die a fool in the process.
I came for treasure and found only death on wings. I tried to step out of the realm, but she wouldn’t let go. It tore most terribly. The Tree bleeds for my foolishness. Her magic will surely ripple through this realm for ages, tearing at its fabric. And for what? I’m dead and she’s escaped just the same. Why did I fight it? Fool, fool, fool.
My only solace is her jailor followed close behind. To Muspel it might have been, or Niflheim. Either way, she’ll be caught…though they’ll need a new prison… I’ve ruined this one.
The Lindwyrm comes for me…”

The Light Elves
*43967*
The Light Elves are back! We freed the Light of Alfheim from whatever the Dark Elves were doing to it, and they all returned to the temple. Everything is beautiful in Alfheim now that the Light shines free. The Light Elves seem nice. They don’t really say anything, but at least they aren’t trying to kill us. Father says I shouldn’t assume anything, but what does he know? He was doing who knows what inside the Light, while I had to take down an entire swarm of Dark Elves by myself. I don’t care what he says… I’m glad we got involved.
*43968*
Svartáljǫfurr
*43969*
We just killed the Dark Elf King that’s been harassing us this whole time. I thought I’d feel good about that, but… just before he died, he said the Light Elves were the bad guys. Could that be true? What if we’ve been fighting against the good guys this whole time? The Light Elves don’t SEEM evil, but… if they really were the ones who started this war, then maybe the Dark Elves were just fighting back? So confusing… I guess I see why Father didn’t want to get involved (but I’m not going to tell him that).
*43970*
Hræzlyr
*43971*
I can’t believe it… Father just killed a dragon! I’ve never seen him fight like that before. I mean, I know he’s really strong and all, but this thing was huge! The dragon’s name was Hræzlyr, which is sort of like the word for “Terror”. It’s an appropriate name too—he’s vicious, ugly, and shoots lightning out of his mouth. Luckily, Father was able to find some Yggdrasil tree sap crystals, and he used them to stun Hræzlyr. Then he stabbed a big crystal into his throat! There was a big explosion, and down went the dragon. I’m still shaking from the excitement, but Father doesn’t even seem fazed. Does he ever get scared?
*43972*
Legion
*43973*
Freya always seems to have more and more magic up her sleeve. First she used her roots to try to restrain Father and Baldur, but they were too strong. Then she reanimated Thamur—the Giant Stone Mason! That was incredible, but it still didn’t work. Baldur kept trying to kill Freya, and we couldn’t let that happen. So we kept fighting, and Freya summoned these weird creatures. They kept trying to grab Father to keep him from fighting. Luckily, they go down easily. There sure are a lot of them though…
*43974*
Valkyrie Spirits
*43975*
These spirits appear after we kill their physical forms, which act as some sort of prison. The spirits have no control over their bodies, which are REALLY powerful. The hardest monster we’ve ever faced, and it’s inhabited by a peaceful spirit. Go figure.

In Search of Freyr
*43982*
“The Light is ours again, but there is no time to lose. Only the return of Lord Freyr can secure peace. Surely we are liberated by forces sent forth at his command, like the sword of legend. But Freyr himself remains lost, and now we must come to his aid. Some believe he has returned to Vanaheim, while others believe he is held in Asgard. Both paths are now found shut. With the temple secure, all Elf-kind is called away to seek out our lost lord.”
*43986*
The Aesir’s Punishment
*43987*
“Captain Erik,
This is our fault. We managed to find a way inside one of the Asgardian Libraries you told us to stay away from, and made off with more coin in one day than we’d see from years of trading. But the thunderstorm that sank your fleet… During the tempest, I had a vision. Thor himself came to me. He appeared on the deck of the Mariusuden in a bolt of lightning, and demanded vengeance. We stole from the gods, he said, and for that, we must be punished. A brilliant flash of light followed, and then everything went dark. We awoke stranded up here. Somehow we managed to survive the shipwreck, though I imagine it is part of the Aesir’s punishment. Now we are forced to live out our last few days stranded on cliff, surrounded by Hel-Walkers and Tatzelwurms. Starving, at each other’s throats. It won’t be long now. Will Aegir be understanding? Will Ran be compassionate? Or will they cast me out to freeze in Hel? I suppose it is not for me to know.
I’m sorry, Captain Erik.”

The stories about the Vanir god, Njord, say he loved the sea. His wife, Skadi, loved the mountains. Seems like an odd pairing.
*44951*
Mother told me about the giantess Skadi and her marriage to the Vanir god, Njord. I guess she choose him only by looking at his feet. Pretty weird. I remember hearing stories about her love for the hunt, mountains and skiing.
*44952*
I had heard the story of Njord and Skadi's wedding before. I guess Skadi had to choose her husband only by looking at his feet. Pretty weird. We found Njord's house, we found Skadi's house, and now we know they had a secret hideaway where they could live together. He loved the sea, she loved the mountains, I wonder where it could be.

(angry scream)
*100001*
[[S:::56215-58340]]
Get in the boat, boy.
*100002*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s010_010_son_stem:49294-50366]]
I found some.
*100003*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s013_010_kra_stem:11520-12685]]
Boy.
*100004*
[[S:::24030-25310]]
That is enough.
*100006*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s020_010_kra_stem:4450-5550]]
That was the last.
*100007*
[[S:::123760-124980]]
Find your way home.
*100008*
[[S:::127410-128190]]
You are free.
*100009*
[[S:::206270-206870]]
Squeeze.
*100010*
[[S:::212380-212980]]
This knife...
*100011*
[[S:::215060-216340]]
It was hers.
*100012*
[[S:::218770-219560]]
Now it is yours.
*100013*
[[S:::226950-227610]]
She taught you to hunt?
*100014*
[[S:::230717-231243]]
Show me.
*100015*
[[S:::232900-233710]]
Now.
*100016*
[[S:::258190-259500]]
You are hunting deer.
*100017*
[[S:::264550-266500]]
In the direction of deer.
*100018*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s020_010_son_stem:43960-45730]]
Lo, there do I see my Mother,
*100019*
[[S:::49710-51990]]
Lo, there do I see my Father,
*100020*
[[S:::57470-59260]]
Lo, there do they call to me.
*100021*
[[S:::68120-69460]]
Lo, there do they call to me.
*100022*
[[S:::76730-78540]]
Lo, there do they call to me.
*100023*
[[S:::79840-81130]]
Lo, there do they call to me.
*100024*
[[S:::82400-83550]]
Lo, there do they call to me.
*100025*
[[S:::101410-102540]]
She’s ready.
*100026*
[[S:::199100-200100]]
I’m sorry...
*100027*
[[S:::229838-230500]]
What she knew.
*100028*
[[S:::232450-232800]]
Now?
*100029*
[[S:::257190-258340]]
What’re we hunting?
*100030*
[[S:::263660-264470]]
Which way?
*100031*
[[S:::267790-271480]]
Okay...? Uhh… this way—
*100032*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s023_010_kra_stem:820-1452]]
Boy.
*100033*
[[S:::2263-3248]]
You missed these.
*100034*
[[S:::14680-16043]]
Your mother taught you well.
*100035*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s023_010_son_stem:4920-5394]]
Huh…
*100036*
[[S:::5980-6470]]
Close...
*100037*
[[S:::7090-8041]]
but also not deer.
*100038*
[[S:::8740-9144]]
See?
*100039*
[[S:::9840-10690]]
Tips are too wide.
*100040*
[[S:::12420-13022]]
Mountain goat?
*100041*
[[S:::19340-19956]]
Yeah...
*100042*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s030_010_son_stem:576-1515]]
There it is!
*100043*
[[S:::17682-18757]]
I’m sorry…
*100044*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s030_010_kra_stem:1551-2087]]
HOLD.
*100045*
[[S:::6030-7270]]
What are you doing?
*100046*
[[S:::7620-11158]]
Now its guard is up! Only fire…
*100047*
[[S:::12739-14048]]
Only fire
*100048*
[[S:::14632-16766]]
when I tell you to fire.
*100049*
[[S:::19100-20190]]
Do not be sorry.
*100050*
[[S:::21280-22698]]
Be better.
*100051*
[[S:::24010-24720]]
Find it.
*100052*
[[S:::29790-30935]]
Find.
*100053*
[[S:::31850-32561]]
It.
*100054*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s050_010_son_stem:5352-5871]]
Look.
*100055*
[[S:::11095-12519]]
Can I have my bow back now?
*100056*
[[S:::18902-20204]]
We should get closer.
*100057*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s050_010_kra_stem:13245-14998]]
Can you hit it from here?
*100058*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s060_010_kra_stem:3700-4860]]
Wait for my mark...
*100059*
[[S:::6490-7281]]
Relax.
*100060*
[[S:::7680-9694]]
Do not think of it as an animal.
*100061*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s060_030_kra_stem:3210-3634]]
Good.
*100062*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s060_030_son_stem:2280-2950]]
I got it.
*100063*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s065_010_kra_stem:5040-6702]]
Your knife...
*100064*
[[S:::10793-12048]]
No.
*100065*
[[S:::12310-14212]]
Finish what you started.
*100066*
[[S:::82190-83637]]
Atreus!
*100067*
[[S:::95320-97400]]
We have no choice.
*100068*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s065_010_son_stem:30070-31655]]
I can’t…
*100069*
[[S:::56315-57583]]
I…
*100070*
[[S:::93575-95650]]
We’re going to fight that?!?
*100071*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s072_010_kra_stem:18350-18860]]
Boy!
*100072*
[[S:::28520-28780]]
BOY!
*100073*
[[S:::29310-31030]]
Look at me! Look at me, boy!
*100074*
[[S:::31470-31900]]
Boy --
*100075*
[[S:::32560-33220]]
look at me!
*100076*
[[S:::43200-44500]]
You are not ready.
*100077*
[[S:::59600-60970]]
We are going home.
*100078*
[[S:::71093-73690]]
You are NOT ready.
*100079*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s072_010_son_stem:15090-16100]]
RAAAA!
*100080*
[[S:::16677-18300]]
That’s what you get!
*100081*
[[S:::20422-22637]]
Think I’m afraid of you?!
*100082*
[[S:::26313-28500]]
You’re nothing to me!
*100083*
[[S:::28800-29300]]
NOTHING!
*100084*
[[S:::36857-37942]]
We DID it.
*100085*
[[S:::48004-48625]]
What?
*100086*
[[S:::49849-51006]]
Are you serious?
*100087*
[[S:::52632-53657]]
I found the deer.
*100088*
[[S:::55485-56711]]
I proved myself.
*100089*
[[S:::58473-59568]]
How am I not ready?
*100090*
[[S:::65610-69850]]
I haven’t been sick in a long time. I can do this.
*100091*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s078_010_kra_stem:2290-3250]]
Inside, boy.
*100092*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s080_010_kra_stem:360-1410]]
You lost control.
*100093*
[[S:::5560-6980]]
Anger can be a weapon
*100094*
[[S:::7900-8840]]
if you control it—
*100095*
[[S:::9210-9850]]
use it.
*100096*
[[S:::10410-11610]]
You clearly cannot.
*100097*
[[S:::12550-13050]]
When you lose…
*100098*
[[S:::18340-18700]]
Fine.
*100099*
[[S:::23240-24040]]
Come on then.
*100100*
[[S:::26750-27700]]
I want you to try.
*100101*
[[S:::33880-34460]]
Try again.
*100102*
[[S:::38350-39160]]
Too slow.
*100103*
[[S:::39610-40440]]
Try again.
*100104*
[[S:::42230-43360]]
Weak. Again.
*100105*
[[S:::44780-45050]]
Again.
*100106*
[[S:::45840-46160]]
AGAIN.
*100107*
[[S:::56970-62510]]
Your anger… you can get lost in it. The path ahead is difficult
*100108*
[[S:::64210-67290]]
and you, Atreus, are clearly not ready.
*100109*
[[S:::70850-71220]]
QUIET.
*100110*
[[S:::93960-96500]]
Boy. Beneath the floor. Now…
*100111*
[[S:::99390-100060]]
I do not know,
*100112*
[[S:::101600-103190]]
I do not know. Get IN.
*100113*
[[S:::135655-136593]]
What do you want?
*100114*
[[S:::142530-144510]]
Whatever it is you seek, I do not have it.
*100115*
[[S:::146940-148030]]
You should move on.
*100116*
[[S:::168180-170570]]
You do not want this fight.
*100117*
[[S:::182560-183660]]
Leave
*100118*
[[S:::184726-185460]]
my
*100119*
[[S:::187395-188540]]
home.
*100120*
[[S:::202760-203970]]
I warned you—
*100121*
[[S:::211050-212330]]
You would not listen.
*100122*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s080_010_son_stem:2004-6137]]
That thing was trying to kill us. It’s not like you don’t get angry in a fight.
*100123*
[[S:::12820-16281]]
I haven’t been sick in a long time. I’m better now.
*100124*
[[S:::25798-26977]]
You want me to hit you?
*100125*
[[S:::32168-34056]]
OWWW! What are you—?
*100126*
[[S:::37831-38787]]
Why are you doing that?
*100127*
[[S:::41921-42565]]
Cut it out!
*100128*
[[S:::45225-45840]]
STOP IT!
*100129*
[[S:::48764-50040]]
(slight cough)
*100130*
[[S:::70078-70811]]
What was that?
*100131*
[[S:::88326-90371]]
What’s going on? Do you know him?
*100132*
[[S:::96433-98034]]
But… you told me never to go down there.
*100133*
[[S:::98699-99300]]
Who is that?
*100134*
[[S:::100593-101556]]
What's he talking about?
*100135*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s080_010_bld_stem:80070-81600]]
Come on out!
*100136*
[[S:::82930-85250]]
It’s no use hiding anymore.
*100137*
[[S:::86130-87810]]
I know who you are……
*100138*
[[S:::90570-93920]]
more importantly, I know what you are!
*100139*
[[S:::107860-110704]]
Just tell me what I want to know!
*100140*
[[S:::110704-112920]]
No need for this to get bloody.
*100141*
[[S:::122766-123554]]
Huh.
*100142*
[[S:::124697-130882]]
Thought you’d be bigger. But you’re definitely the one.
*100143*
[[S:::132523-134334]]
Long way from home, aren’t you?
*100144*
[[S:::137000-141781]]
Oh, you already know the answer to that.
*100145*
[[S:::148969-155037]]
Hahaha. And here I thought your kind was supposed to be so enlightened.
*100146*
[[S:::155037-158561]]
So much better than us. So much smarter.
*100147*
[[S:::158561-166008]]
And yet you hide out here in the woods—like a coward.
*100148*
[[S:::171091-177297]]
Oh… I’m pretty sure I do.
*100149*
[[S:::189712-195089]]
You are going to have to kill me for that to happen.
*100150*
[[S:::205134-207139]]
Finally.
*100151*
[[S:::213494-218498]]
No… No, no, no, no. no, no, no, no, no.
*100152*
[[S:::225032-227000]]
Fine. My turn.
*100153*
[[S:::241000-246520]]
How incredibly disappointing.
*100154*
[[S:::246520-248018]]
Come on, then.
*100155*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s100_010_kra_stem:12340-12790]]
Boy.
*100156*
[[S:::22230-23200]]
I am all right.
*100157*
[[S:::25280-25590]]
Come.
*100158*
[[S:::29980-31010]]
Gather your things.
*100159*
[[S:::31770-32340]]
We are leaving.
*100160*
[[S:::39410-43190]]
You are not. But we have no choice now.
*100161*
[[S:::49210-50490]]
Prove me wrong.
*100162*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s100_010_son_stem:14980-17570]]
There was so much… I thought…
*100163*
[[S:::20670-21640]]
You’re all right.
*100164*
[[S:::37540-38000]]
Thought I wasn’t ready.
*100165*
[[S:::51820-52060]]
Yes, sir.
*100166*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s110_010_son_stem:8490-8720]]
Look...
*100167*
[[S:::10640-11500]]
All this time...
*100168*
[[S:::12240-14620]]
there’s been a protection stave around our entire woods.
*100169*
[[S:::15910-16170]]
But...
*100170*
[[S:::17820-19110]]
the stave’s broken there.
*100171*
[[S:::22570-23520]]
Did you cut those down?
*100172*
[[S:::31360-32180]]
Why’d she do that?
*100173*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro_s110_010_kra_stem:25890-28400]]
She hand-marked the trees she wished used for her pyre…
*100174*
[[S:::42480-42840]]
Come.
*100175*
[[S:::44330-45250]]
No looking back now.
*100176*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s010_010_son:0-1500]]
Still want me to tie it to the boat?
*100181*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s020_010_son:0-397]]
Father?
*100182*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s020_020_kra:9-304]]
What?
*100183*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s020_030_son:40-890]]
Did something change?
*100184*
[[S:::1890-4593]]
The forest feels different now.
*100185*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s020_040_kra:0-1774]]
Everything is different, boy.
*100186*
[[S:::2520-3575]]
Try not to dwell on it.
*100187*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s020_050_son:18-503]]
Yes, sir.
*100188*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s030_010_son:0-410]]
Father… why are we
*100189*
[[S:::1390-2250]]
doing this now?
*100190*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s030_020_kra:0-2000]]
I need to know you can survive the journey.
*100191*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s030_030_son:26-1158]]
Then we leave for the mountain?
*100192*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s030_040_kra:0-770]]
Depends on you.
*100193*
[[S:::1770-2000]]
Hunt.
*100194*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s030_050_son:7-1023]]
Father! Over here!
*100195*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s033_010_son:68-1196]]
Thought we were going hunting?
*100196*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s037_010_son:172-1280]]
What are you doing back there?
*100197*
[[S:::1884-3057]]
The hunting grounds are this way.
*100198*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s040_010_kra:22-982]]
What did you find?
*100199*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s040_020_son:7-548]]
Tracks.
*100200*
[[S:::1340-2004]]
Not deer though.
*100201*
[[S:::3002-3591]]
I’ll keep looking.
*100202*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s050_010_kra:0-750]]
More tracks?
*100203*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s050_020_son:0-320]]
Yeah.
*100204*
[[S:::1000-2050]]
But they’re too round.
*100205*
[[S:::2770-3540]]
Could be a wild boar.
*100206*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s050_030_kra:0-350]]
Good.
*100207*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s060_100_kra:117-3096]]
It is simply a target. Clear your mind.
*100208*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s060_105_kra:115-2205]]
Pick your spot and focus on it.
*100209*
[[S:::2694-3581]]
Relax.
*100210*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s060_110_kra:90-1040]]
Relax…
*100211*
[[S:::1660-2250]]
Focus…
*100212*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s060_145_kra:170-1220]]
Feet solid.
*100213*
[[S:::1940-3000]]
Steady yourself.
*100214*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s060_150_kra:140-1000]]
Keep that elbow up.
*100215*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s060_155_kra:77-816]]
Breathe.
*100216*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s060_200_son:0-750]]
I can do this.
*100217*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s060_200_son_a:0-830]]
I can do this.
*100218*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s060_205_son_a:60-705]]
(inhaled breath)
*100219*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s060_205_son_b:79-879]]
(inhaled breath)
*100220*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s060_205_son_c:37-795]]
(inhaled breath)
*100221*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s060_205_son_d:129-885]]
(inhaled breath)
*100222*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s060_205_son_e:163-1028]]
(inhaled breath)
*100223*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s060_210_son:66-2084]]
Sorry.  I’ll get it this time.
*100224*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s060_220_son:0-780]]
I’ve got this.
*100225*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s060_115_kra:70-2400]]
Steady your aim and breathe in.
*100226*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s060_120_kra:50-600]]
Good.
*100227*
[[S:::990-2250]]
Now draw to your chin.
*100228*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s060_125_kra:50-1190]]
Your mark is there.
*100229*
[[S:::2360-2750]]
Draw.
*100230*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s060_130_kra:70-1250]]
Exhale and release.
*100231*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s060_135_kra:95-562]]
Now.
*100232*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s060_140_kra:0-1000]]
Take your shot, boy.
*100235*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s065_010_son:9-883]]
Are you coming?
*100236*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s065_020_son:40-1920]]
Here. Just follow the stairs up.
*100237*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s070_010_son:33-705]]
Over here.
*100238*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s071_005_son:73-1972]]
Oop. Now what?
*100239*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s071_010_kra:60-1020]]
This way, boy.
*100240*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s071_020_son:470-1490]]
Didn’t think I’d make it.
*100241*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s080_010_son:0-244]]
Wait.
*100242*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s080_020_son:0-1360]]
Deer tracks. They’re fresh.
*100243*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s080_030_son:8-404]]
This way.
*100244*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s085_010_son:6-447]]
Aaah!
*100245*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s085_020_son:18-564]]
Found it!
*100246*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s085_030_kra:0-1114]]
Slow down, boy!
*100247*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s100_010_son:23-639]]
Sorry…
*100248*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s100_020_kra:40-2500]]
You are hunting deer—not chasing it.
*100249*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s100_030_son:0-640]]
Yes, father.
*100250*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s120_010_son:0-1160]]
He broke our bridge…
*100251*
[[S:::1700-2750]]
how are we gonna get across?
*100252*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s120_020_kra:15-969]]
Step aside.
*100253*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s120_030_son:0-650]]
Wow.
*100254*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s120_040_kra:8-424]]
Go.
*100255*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s125_010_son:0-720]]
Woah.
*100256*
[[S:::1240-2091]]
What happened here?
*100257*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s130_010_son:22-400]]
Ahh!
*100258*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s130_020_son:0-430]]
My bow!
*100259*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s130_030_kra:0-480]]
No!
*100260*
[[S:::850-2750]]
You are not ready—stay back!
*100261*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s130_040_son:11-1189]]
Father! Above you!
*100262*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s140_010_son:50-650]]
Draugr?
*100263*
[[S:::1600-3480]]
They’ve never come this close to our woods before.
*100264*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s140_030_kra:20-660]]
Keep moving.
*100265*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s142_010_son:120-3295]]
Uh… deer’s this way. I can see more tracks.
*100266*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s142_020_son:20-1193]]
… or we can follow you.
*100267*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s150_010_kra:110-1000]]
Mind the edge, boy.
*100268*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s160_010_son:20-970]]
That hanging bucket,
*100269*
[[S:::2050-2940]]
an offering cask?
*100270*
[[S:::4140-7956]]
Mother said Odin’s disciples fill them with gifts and hang them where thieves can’t reach them.
*100271*
[[S:::8590-9659]]
That one looked really old.
*100272*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s160_010_son_a:30-1010]]
That hanging bucket.
*100273*
[[S:::1730-2880]]
Is that an offering cask?
*100274*
[[S:::4100-8012]]
Mother said Odin’s disciples fill them with gifts and hang them where thieves can’t reach them.
*100275*
[[S:::9171-10286]]
That one looked really old.
*100276*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s160_020_kra:36-731]]
Foolish…
*100277*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s160_030_son:40-630]]
What is?
*100278*
[[S:::1420-2452]]
Worshipping the gods?
*100279*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s160_040_kra:100-1800]]
The gods care nothing for them.
*100280*
[[S:::2330-4250]]
Men should not pray to monsters.
*100281*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s200_010_son:9-888]]
They were just hungry.
*100282*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s200_020_kra:6-330]]
What?
*100283*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s200_030_son:0-1714]]
The wolves. They weren’t mean.
*100284*
[[S:::2040-2794]]
They were starving.
*100285*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s200_040_kra:30-570]]
Yes.
*100286*
[[S:::1150-2299]]
I imagine they were.
*100287*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s203_010_son:50-1000]]
Should we be in here?
*100288*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s203_020_kra:150-3000]]
We do what we please boy, no excuses.
*100289*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s210_010_son:34-4933]]
Up there! He went in the old temple. But Mom told me never to go in there.
*100290*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s210_011_kra:50-3000]]
We do what we please, boy. No excuses.
*100291*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s210_010_son_a:60-717]]
Up there!
*100292*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s210_010_son_b:130-2950]]
He went in the old temple. But Mom told me never to go in there.
*100293*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s220_010_son:50-2130]]
I went hunting with mother a bunch of times.
*100294*
[[S:::2880-4110]]
You never wanted to take me.
*100295*
[[S:::5460-6000]]
Why now?
*100296*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s220_010_son_a:150-2030]]
I went hunting with mother a bunch of times.
*100297*
[[S:::2790-3890]]
You never wanted to take me.
*100298*
[[S:::5540-6000]]
Why now?
*100299*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s220_020_kra:140-950]]
It was her wish.
*100300*
[[S:::1700-2370]]
And…
*100301*
[[S:::2920-3500]]
it was time.
*100302*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s220_030_son:4-297]]
Okay.
*100303*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s232_010_son:77-599]]
What was that?
*100304*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s232_010_son_a:51-564]]
What was that?
*100305*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s232_020_kra:90-1140]]
It does not matter.
*100306*
[[S:::1580-2500]]
Stay focused.
*100307*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s235_010_son:20-940]]
Is that a coffin?
*100308*
[[S:::1770-2250]]
Out here?
*100309*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s240_010_son:29-3124]]
Whew. I half-expected there to be a troll under that bridge.
*100310*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s240_020_kra:0-2000]]
You are not ready for trolls, boy.
*100311*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s240_030_son:290-1000]]
I know. I just—
*100312*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s240_040_son:870-1500]]
Yes father.
*100313*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s240_040_son_a:940-1590]]
Yes father.
*100314*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s250_010_son:8-1353]]
Something’s gotta open that gate…
*100315*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s250_020_son:0-543]]
It’s opening.
*100316*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s250_030_son:3-2908]]
Huh… won’t stay open. What now?
*100317*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s250_040_son:7-1457]]
Is that big gear up there made of wood?
*100318*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s250_050_son:0-1140]]
You froze it in place.
*100319*
[[S:::1590-2000]]
Clever.
*100320*
[[S:::2824-4321]]
Think you could’ve frozen draugr with it?
*100321*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s250_050_son_a:0-1140]]
You froze it in place.
*100322*
[[S:::1590-2000]]
Clever.
*100323*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s250_051_kra:120-2250]]
No. It does not work like that.
*100324*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s250_060_son:9-684]]
Sooo…
*100325*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s250_070_son:0-549]]
Nice.
*100326*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s250_080_son:8-2296]]
Uh… you didn’t mean to do that, did you?
*100327*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s260_010_son:20-2459]]
Where you going? I think he’s this way.
*100328*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s260_020_son:7-228]]
Oh.
*100329*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s290_010_son:0-410]]
Father…
*100330*
[[S:::1030-1330]]
look.
*100331*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s292_010_son:0-320]]
It’s… it’s still
*100332*
[[S:::1455-2414]]
alive.
*100333*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s298_010_son:0-1000]]
Okay—just tell me when to shoot!
*100334*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s300_001_son:20-1000]]
He’s too strong!
*100335*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s300_002_son:4-889]]
Why won’t he fall?!?
*100336*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s300_003_son:120-610]]
WHOA!
*100337*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s300_004_son:7-1301]]
My arrows aren’t hurting him!
*100338*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s300_005_son:5-1735]]
I keep hitting him! Why isn’t he falling?
*100339*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s300_006_son:3-1455]]
My arrows only make him angry!
*100340*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s300_007_son:8-1210]]
Fall, dammit! FALL!
*100341*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s300_009_kra:0-1500]]
Get control of yourself boy!
*100342*

Boy!

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s300_020_son:4-1749]]
I’m FINE. Kill it!

I AM ready.

Do not speak again.
*100346*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s312_010_son:50-1250]]
The path home is this way.
*100347*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s312_020_son:28-604]]
Duh.
*100348*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s320_010_son:0-1852]]
Still can’t get the doors open, huh?
*100349*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s320_020_kra:0-534]]
Quiet.
*100350*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s330_010_son:0-1980]]
I told you something was different about the forest.
*100351*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s330_020_kra:0-1500]]
And I told you not to speak.
*100352*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s330_030_son:84-4913]]
But why would a Fire Troll burn mother’s garden? And since when are Draugr so close to the house?
*100353*
[[S:::4913-7278]]
And what was that frozen thing that attacked us?

Who was he?

Who was he?

I do not know.
*100577*

What did he want with us? We’re nobodies.
*100578*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s460_050_son:0-750]]
Did you kill him?

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s460_060_kra:0-1500]]
I did what had to be done.
*100580*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s465_010_son:60-1000]]
You could have died.
*100581*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s465_020_son:0-2000]]
Never leave me alone again. All right?

You’ve had to kill people before, haven’t you?

You’re used to it.

We do what we must to survive.

Animals, I get.

They’re food.

[[S:::3400-5867]]
Draugr… they’re supposed to be dead.

[[S:::5867-9733]]
But people… they’re trying to survive too.
*100593*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s490_040_kra:0-1500]]
Close your heart to it. On our journey,
*100594*
[[S:::2340-5650]]
we will be attacked by all manner of creature.
*100595*
[[S:::6460-8470]]
Close your heart to their desperation.

Close your heart to their suffering.

[[S:::11670-13830]]
Do not allow yourself to feel for them.

They will not feel for you.

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s490_050_son:0-500]]
I understand.

Yes.

No.

They’ll try and rob us?

how long will it take to get to the mountain?

Okay…
*100621*
[[S:::1110-2240]]
nowhere to go from here…
*100622*
[[S:::2800-4090]]
except across this bridge.
*100623*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s536_040_son:0-1300]]
Think you can lower it from there?
*100624*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s536_050_son:0-5250]]
Wait… is that some kind of a crank? Back there, to the right of where I came up…
*100625*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro_s536_060_kra:11-545]]
Go.
*100626*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s536_070_son:40-652]]
Made it!

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s536_080_son:55-605]]
Hey!
*100628*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s536_090_son:63-2319]]
Just keep the bridge down and I can make it across.
*100629*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s536_100_son:55-4121]]
Wait… can’t you keep the bridge down somehow? How are you gonna get across?
*100630*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s536_110_son:74-820]]
Good idea…
*100631*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro_s536_120_son:78-2376]]

This way…

Move.
*100640*
[[S:::8395-9309]]
Not yet!
*100641*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s115_020_son_stem:1098-2616]]
Father, help!

Sorry…

Uh… more Draugr. But these aren’t moving. Are they dead? I mean… more dead?

Not dead! Not dead!

[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s115_020_kra_stem:2600-3833]]
Hang on!
*100649*
[[S:::7260-8927]]
Stay calm.
*100650*
[[S:::9184-10450]]
Almost there…
*100651*
[[S:::22960-25103]]
SLOW DOWN.
*100652*
[[S:::25270-27286]]
Your haste will cost us.
*100653*
[[S:::41475-42962]]
Booooy…

Echh... What’s that smell?

Meat? Wait—us?

[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s118_010_kra_stem:24810-25460]]
Behind me.
*100657*
[[S:::32900-34672]]
This fight is mine alone.
*100658*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s118_010_bd1_stem:9980-10600]]
NOW!!
*100659*
[[S:::12228-13476]]
Are they Hel-Walkers?
*100660*
[[S:::18312-19593]]
Siegmund, your knives!
*100661*
[[S:::26110-27489]]
What if they change like the others?
*100662*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s118_010_bd2_stem:14736-16207]]
They’re untouched! Look!
*100663*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s118_010_bd3_stem:16510-18120]]
Someone start the fires!
*100664*
[[S:::19670-22181]]
So many days... without meat.
*100665*
[[S:::27820-32401]]
We’ll have to keep them alive. Strip off their meat... a little at a time.
*100666*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s120a_010_son_stem:3378-5976]]
Father! Help me!
*100667*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s120a_010_kra_stem:9890-10400]]
Atreus!
*100668*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s120b_010_kra_stem:32150-33590]]
Close your heart to it.
*100669*
[[S:::38290-38780]]
Come then.
*100670*
[[S:::39580-41070]]
We have a long journey ahead—
*100671*
[[S:::54600-55430]]
Wait here.
*100672*
[[S:::58690-59590]]
I will handle this.
*100673*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s120b_010_son_stem:986-3955]]
(breathing efforts)
*100674*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s128_010_brk_stem:2250-4842]]
Get up and move your ass!
*100675*
[[S:::6199-9569]]
I’ll kick you square in the ringer you don’t move!
*100676*
[[S:::10993-12794]]
C’moooooon!
*100677*
[[S:::17487-18487]]
Oh…
*100678*
[[S:::19043-23896]]
Whatcha waitin’ for? C'mon already! LET'S GO!
*100679*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s129_010_brk_stem:542-2220]]
Grrrrrahhhh!
*100680*
[[S:::5699-10115]]
Can’t get this sloe-eyed cocklump to cross the bridge! Hrmph!
*100681*
[[S:::13113-14377]]
There’s what now?
*100682*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s129_010_son_stem:10834-13181]]
It’s because she’s scared of something in the trees over there.
*100683*
[[S:::17926-21642]]
Father, throw your axe at those trees on the other side of the bridge—
*100684*
[[S:::22058-23592]]
the ones with the white trunks.
*100685*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s130_010_kra_stem:4114-5547]]
You were right...
*100686*
[[S:::69191-72240]]
You are right...I do not believe you.
*100687*
[[S:::72900-74025]]
Come, boy.
*100688*
[[S:::99366-100550]]
Very well.
*100689*
[[S:::101460-103521]]
I expect an improvement.
*100690*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s130_010_brk_stem:5570-10243]]
Hey… you must be smart or somethin’, boy.
*100691*
[[S:::10320-11850]]
You are a boy, aren’tcha?
*100692*
[[S:::12900-14241]]
HAAA!
*100693*
[[S:::15980-16810]]
I dunno.
*100694*
[[S:::17390-23462]]
Rude bastard ain’t ever asked mine so I ain’t ever asked hers. HAAA!!
*100695*
[[S:::25244-26047]]
Brok.
*100696*
[[S:::33523-34426]]
Huh.
*100697*
[[S:::35800-42968]]
Say… you’re not gonna believe me but uh… that axe you got, uh?
*100698*
[[S:::43554-47353]]
It was me what made her—me and my brother.
*100699*
[[S:::47431-49175]]
Was one of our best.
*100700*
[[S:::49274-53816]]
So don’t let nobody else go work on her except for us two. AAACH!
*100701*
[[S:::54649-60100]]
You gotta handle her special or she’ll wreck beyond fixin’.
*100702*
[[S:::60281-65198]]
I can enhance her for you right now if it so pleases you son of a bitch.
*100703*
[[S:::66274-69000]]
So what say you? HAA!
*100704*
[[S:::75611-79140]]
There’s a rune in the shape of a fork—under the grip.
*100705*
[[S:::80986-84908]]
Aw… digr bikkja! Dumbr bak-rauf!
*100706*
[[S:::87531-93429]]
That was our brand, my brother and me, before we split. I got half of it right here—see?
*100707*
[[S:::95352-98490]]
Look, you want I should upgrade her or not?
*100708*
[[S:::113356-118551]]
Oh, my dumb brother’s got it. But I got all the talent. Look!
*100709*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s130_010_son_stem:14614-15481]]
She have a name?
*100710*
[[S:::23955-24700]]
What’s yours?
*100711*
[[S:::27941-29251]]
Vera logn...
*100712*
[[S:::110769-113100]]
So where’s the other half of the brand?
*100713*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s135_010_son_stem:10812-11665]]
Wow...
*100714*
[[S:::13020-15279]]
Never been this close to the mountain before.
*100715*
[[S:::16170-17685]]
Looks so big.
*100716*
[[S:::20770-22934]]
I wish Mom was here to see it.
*100717*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s135_010_kra_stem:36900-38126]]
Come, boy.
*100718*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s136_010_kra_stem:3250-3719]]
Boy…
*100719*
[[S:::5099-5902]]
These tracks…
*100720*
[[S:::11380-11770]]
Go.
*100721*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s136_010_son_stem:6488-10814]]
Mm… a boar maybe? Not sure. But I’ll find it.
*100722*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s137_010_kra_stem:2590-3520]]
Shoot when you are ready.
*100723*
[[S:::4230-7120]]
Remember… draw to your chest. A wild boar’s hide is thick.
*100724*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s137b_010_son_stem:1280-2900]]
But… I hit it. Didn’t I?
*100725*
[[S:::3470-5540]]
I did what you said and it looked like it bounced off.
*100726*
[[S:::6600-7930]]
Could the boar be magical?
*100727*
[[S:::12670-14500]]
It looked weirder than any boar I’ve ever seen…
*100728*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s137b_010_kra_stem:7940-8440]]
Hunh.
*100729*
[[S:::11100-11840]]
What do you think?
*100730*
[[S:::15050-15950]]
Get after it then.
*100731*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s140_010_son_stem:11440-11990]]
I got it.
*100732*
[[S:::14830-15460]]
Elbow up.
*100733*
[[S:::16000-16850]]
Steady hand.
*100734*
[[S:::17430-18240]]
Relax…
*100735*
[[S:::19460-20700]]
accuracy over speed…
*100736*
[[S:::23200-23610]]
YES!
*100737*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s140_010_kra_stem:24440-25170]]
Do not lose it!
*100738*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s150a_010_son_stem:9095-10567]]
We didn’t know he belonged to anyone.
*100739*
[[S:::26075-27101]]
Target practice…
*100740*
[[S:::30097-31858]]
I’m so so sorry...
*100741*
[[S:::35354-36327]]
Will he die?
*100742*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s150a_010_kra_stem:13292-14961]]
The boy was following my command.
*100743*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s150a_010_fre_stem:10750-12470]]
He doesn’t. He’s my friend.
*100744*
[[S:::16320-17460]]
Then help fix this.
*100745*
[[S:::17730-19340]]
Hold here please.
*100746*
[[S:::19340-20700]]
HOLD, I said. He’s losing blood.
*100747*
[[S:::21710-24030]]
The last of his kind in all the realm and you shoot him.
*100748*
[[S:::24440-25310]]
You needed food?
*100749*
[[S:::28020-29340]]
Target practice...
*100750*
[[S:::31720-33010]]
Keep that pressure on.
*100751*
[[S:::33010-34870]]
The blame is mine. I should have kept a closer eye.
*100752*
[[S:::36323-37618]]
I will not let him.
*100753*
[[S:::37707-42798]]
You—the arrow cut a tideway inside him. Find both ends and hold them tightly.
*100754*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s150b_010_fre_stem:1430-3020]]
Sunnan-
*100755*
[[S:::3781-5821]]
þoka.
*100756*
[[S:::12460-13880]]
I can’t finish the healing here.
*100757*
[[S:::14430-15960]]
My home is just beyond the trees there.
*100758*
[[S:::16480-17390]]
You’ll carry him?
*100759*
[[S:::21150-22700]]
He must not die.
*100760*
[[S:::27070-29540]]
Good. He seems stable and calm for now.
*100761*
[[S:::32460-34707]]
Greiða!
*100762*
[[S:::37000-37727]]
This way.
*100763*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s150b_010_son_stem:10698-11974]]
You’re a witch…
*100764*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s150c_010_fre:880-3250]]
Start with the left side. Grab it and hold.
*100765*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s150c_020_fre:760-2500]]
Now the right side. Hold it tight.
*100766*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s150c_030_fre:640-2250]]
Please—keep a steady grip.
*100767*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s150c_040_fre:470-2500]]
Grab and hold the left end of the tideway.
*100768*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s150c_050_fre:440-2500]]
You need to grab and hold both ends.
*100769*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s150c_060_son:140-1215]]
Father, please!
*100770*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s150c_070_fre:190-2750]]
Good. Now pull them together—line them up.
*100771*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s160_010_fre_stem:630-1850]]
Place him on the stave there.
*100772*
[[S:::6290-7310]]
Keep him still.
*100773*
[[S:::16030-16760]]
It’s better this way.
*100774*
[[S:::21790-23430]]
Hold him still—before he hurts himself.
*100775*
[[S:::24990-25240]]
Good.
*100776*
[[S:::28470-28920]]
Easy…
*100777*
[[S:::30260-30870]]
rest now…
*100778*
[[S:::33540-37990]]
I need two more things. Fresh red root grows just behind the house. Can you pull a cluster?
*100779*
[[S:::48524-49187]]
I…
*100780*
[[S:::52500-54229]]
I know you’re a god.
*100781*
[[S:::55570-57610]]
Not of this realm, but there’s no mistaking it.
*100782*
[[S:::59830-64500]]
He doesn’t know, does he?  About your true nature—or his own?
*100783*
[[S:::65590-70400]]
The gods of these realms don’t take kindly to outsiders. Trust me, I know.
*100784*
[[S:::71030-75460]]
When they find you—and they will—they’ll make things difficult.
*100785*
[[S:::76450-78000]]
The boy will want answers.
*100786*
[[S:::79290-82170]]
Whatever you’re hiding, you cannot protect him forever.
*100787*
[[S:::83690-84871]]
But you’re right……
*100788*
[[S:::86420-87710]]
doesn’t concern me.
*100789*
[[S:::90230-92149]]
I also need Lamb’s Cress. Do you mind?
*100790*
[[S:::92839-95637]]
It’s a white-petalled flower in my garden. Just a handful.
*100791*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s160_010_son_stem:13370-14060]]
You live alone?
*100792*
[[S:::17090-19080]]
Yeah, my father doesn’t like people either.
*100793*
[[S:::19700-20760]]
Well, you don’t.
*100794*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s160_010_kra_stem:19080-19600]]
Boy.
*100795*
[[S:::45010-45580]]
What else?
*100796*
[[S:::64050-65370]]
That is none of your concern.
*100797*
[[S:::77570-79010]]
That will be my problem.
*100798*
[[S:::99300-99910]]
Fine.
*100799*
[[S:::101030-102000]]
Lamb’s Cress…
*100800*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s163_010_kra_stem:4840-5620]]
Would this help?
*100801*
[[S:::11080-12480]]
When you were chasing the animal.
*100802*
[[S:::18540-19880]]
You did lose it.
*100803*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s163_010_son_stem:9830-10730]]
I dropped it…?
*100804*
[[S:::13870-15070]]
What’s wrong with me?
*100805*
[[S:::17020-18640]]
If I’d lost it…
*100806*
[[S:::25420-27132]]
I’ll take better care of it from now on.
*100807*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s165_010_fre_stem:15766-17677]]
Ah, exactly what I need.
*100808*
[[S:::26470-27000]]
Yes.
*100809*
[[S:::30560-31010]]
Wait…
*100810*
[[S:::32770-33680]]
Not without thanks.
*100811*
[[S:::42870-43830]]
You want solitude?
*100812*
[[S:::44960-46300]]
This mark will hide you from
*100813*
[[S:::48800-50840]]
those who might make your journey… difficult.
*100814*
[[S:::57100-58150]]
Leyna.
*100815*
[[S:::68880-69970]]
Leyna.
*100816*
[[S:::72970-73902]]
Heimili!
*100817*
[[S:::78345-82647]]
There’s a shortcut below the house that leads safely out of these woods.
*100818*
[[S:::83159-84888]]
Follow this path down,
*100819*
[[S:::85435-86816]]
then head towards daylight.
*100820*
[[S:::94303-96432]]
As much or as little as you like.
*100821*
[[S:::97308-98267]]
Now get out of here.
*100822*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s165_010_son_stem:24196-25517]]
So he’s going to live?
*100823*
[[S:::91203-92579]]
Will we see you again?
*100824*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv01_s165_010_kra_stem:29030-30020]]
Then we are leaving.
*100825*
[[S:::99620-100588]]
Come, boy.
*100826*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s010_010_son:0-929]]
They don’t see us.
*100827*
[[S:::1550-2250]]
Should I fire?
*100828*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s010_020_kra:30-1250]]
Wait for my mark.
*100829*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s010_030_son:27-1085]]
Are we going to attack?
*100830*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s010_040_son:18-1006]]
What are we waiting for?
*100831*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s010_050_son:25-734]]
Why aren’t we—
*100832*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s010_060_kra:30-2090]]
Be silent and do not question me.
*100833*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s020_010_son:0-1400]]
How was that? Did I help?
*100834*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s020_020_kra:0-1010]]
If you want to help,
*100835*
[[S:::1400-2080]]
distract them.
*100836*
[[S:::2430-6500]]
Whoever is not my focus should be yours… but only when safe to do so.
*100837*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s020_030_son:0-490]]
I can do that.
*100838*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s020_040_son:0-500]]
Anything else?
*100839*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s020_050_kra:0-2750]]
Space your shots. Speed costs accuracy.
*100840*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s020_060_son:5-303]]
Got it.
*100841*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s040_010_son:10-1371]]
Two more! Over there!
*100842*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s050_010_son:0-500]]
How was that?
*100843*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s050_020_kra:0-420]]
Better.
*100844*
[[S:::1090-2150]]
But keep your distance.
*100845*
[[S:::2750-3500]]
Give me space.
*100846*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s050_030_son:0-750]]
And take my time.
*100847*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s050_040_kra:5-556]]
Correct.
*100848*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s060_010_son:6-466]]
Look there…
*100849*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s060_020_son:119-5201]]
(murmured reading)
*100850*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s060_021_son:16-1214]]
There’s a Jötnar settlement ahead…
*100851*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s060_030_kra:9-617]]
Jötnar?
*100852*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s060_040_son:8-481]]
Giants.
*100853*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s060_050_kra:0-940]]
You can read the writing?
*100854*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s060_060_son_a:110-610]]
Some—
*100855*
[[S:::1610-2810]]
just the languages mother knew.
*100856*
[[S:::3800-6500]]
They’re all sort of connected, so I can kind of piece it together.
*100857*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s060_060_son:0-360]]
Some—
*100858*
[[S:::1270-2350]]
just the languages mother knew.
*100859*
[[S:::3180-6745]]
But they’re all sort of connected so sometimes I can feel my way through stuff I shouldn’t know. Ya know?
*100860*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s110_010_kra:20-2445]]
Remember: Accuracy over speed!
*100861*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s111_010_son:30-2150]]
That was the last one. Was I better?
*100862*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s111_020_kra:0-1250]]
Take even more time.
*100863*
[[S:::1740-4010]]
It does not matter if you fire only once.
*100864*
[[S:::4680-5500]]
Show me control.
*100865*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s112_010_son:8-538]]
Look at this…
*100866*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s112_020_kra:0-430]]
Read it.
*100867*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s112_031_son:0-340]]
Oh.
*100868*
[[S:::790-2030]]
This used to be a marketplace.
*100869*
[[S:::2560-5710]]
The Giants used to gather here to trade with the gods a long time ago.
*100870*
[[S:::6310-7450]]
Wonder if Odin was ever here…
*100871*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s113_030_son:18-1198]]
There’s something up there!
*100872*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s113_020_son:36-2223]]
Above us! Something’s breaking through the wall!
*100873*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s113_022_son:147-2973]]
Look—above us! Something’s breaking through!
*100874*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s113_023_son:99-2048]]
Something’s breaking through the wall! Up there!
*100875*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s113_021_son:99-1373]]
Something’s breaking through the wall!
*100876*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s113_050_son:41-1032]]
Draugr!
*100877*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s113_060_son:22-1855]]
More draugr!
*100878*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s114_010_son:0-1420]]
I guess we need to get back up there.
*100879*
[[S:::1970-2500]]
But how?
*100880*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s114_020_kra:12-872]]
Follow me.
*100881*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s115a_010_son:14-2020]]
Look—there’s an opening up there.
*100882*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s115a_020_son:8-2591]]
Right up there… Look—an opening.
*100883*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s115a_032_son:0-650]]
Help!
*100884*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s115a_034_son:210-1900]]
I can’t—I can’t hold on!
*100885*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s116_010_son:27-3248]]
Uh… do you hear that? What is it?
*100886*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s116_020_kra:0-740]]
We will see.
*100887*
[[S:::1410-2690]]
Stay close.
*100888*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s116_030_son:4-621]]
What is that?
*100889*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s116_031_son:13-1373]]
Doesn’t sound like a good thing…
*100890*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s116_040_son:14-2113]]
So we’re going towards the scary singing?
*100891*
[[S:WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s116a_010_wit:6-1595]]

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s118a_010_son:0-583]]
Revenant!!
*100897*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s118a_020_son:57-795]]
It’s a Revenant!!
*100898*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119_010_son:35-2937]]
That was a real Revenant! Never thought I’d see one up close…
*100899*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119a_010_son:0-1347]]
So that’s how you get down here!
*100900*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119a_010_son_a:21-1474]]
So that’s how you get down here!
*100901*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119b_010_son:31-3161]]
Wait… you don’t suppose Revenant travel in packs, do you?
*100902*
[[S:::3664-5567]]
And there’s a bunch of ’em waiting up there for us?
*100903*
[[S:::5997-6825]]
And they’re really mad?
*100904*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s119b_020_kra:0-637]]
Boy.
*100905*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119b_030_son:0-590]]
Sorry.
*100906*
[[S:::1080-1894]]
Imagination.
*100907*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s121_010_son:0-430]]
Earlier… you said people might try and rob us.
*100908*
[[S:::890-3910]]
I’ll kill them if they try.
*100909*
[[S:::4510-5000]]
I’m not afraid.
*100910*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s121_020_kra:70-2290]]
If we encounter men, you will stay out of it,
*100911*
[[S:::2750-3250]]
understand?
*100912*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s121_030_son:0-1550]]
But… I can fight now.
*100913*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s121_040_kra:0-1680]]
You will stay out of it, boy.
*100914*
[[S:::2280-3500]]
Speak no more of this.
*100915*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s123_010_son:27-2793]]
I still don’t understand why that man attacked you at our house.
*100916*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s123_020_kra:30-2500]]
I told you, boy, I know nothing more of it.
*100917*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s124_010_son:2-995]]
What’s that over there?
*100918*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s124_020_son:8-815]]
You see that too?
*100919*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s124_030_son:0-1900]]
Hey… I think there’s a chest over there.
*100920*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s124_040_son:31-2002]]
Behind us… what’s that over there?
*100921*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s124_050_son:3-1251]]
Father! Behind you!
*100922*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119c_010_son:40-1450]]
I see stuff on the other side…
*100923*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119c_020_son:0-1250]]
Gotta be a way to drop the bridge…
*100924*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119c_030_son:0-1250]]
Wish we could break that chain.
*100925*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119c_040_son:0-1400]]
Chains on both sides maybe?
*100926*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119c_050_son:0-1250]]
Maybe each side has a chain?
*100927*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s119c_060_kra:50-1500]]
Now back to the bridge outside.
*100928*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119c_070_son:70-2800]]
Hey,
*100929*
[[S:::3240-3970]]
maybe the way out’s through that draw bridge back there—that was chained up?
*100930*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119c_080_son:58-796]]
That did it!
*100931*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119d_005_son:30-900]]
This should get us across…
*100932*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119d_010_son:0-514]]
Whoops.
*100933*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119d_020_son:30-1160]]
So… that happened again.
*100934*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s119d_030_kra:0-500]]
Silence.
*100935*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119d_040_son:50-1250]]
Something’s resetting the bridge…
*100936*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119d_050_son:310-2110]]
Oh, I bet that weight is resetting it.
*100937*
[[S:::2680-4000]]
See there—under the bridge?
*100938*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119d_051_son:0-1900]]
There’s gotta be some way to get rid of that weight…
*100939*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119d_060_son:69-724]]
You did it.
*100940*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s119d_060_kra:0-1000]]
Let me focus.
*100941*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s119e_010_son:30-800]]
All these dead… you think
*100942*
[[S:::1280-2310]]
it’s safe in there?
*100943*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s119e_020_kra:120-1400]]
You think it safer out here?
*100944*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s120_010_kra:9-60410]]
Boy?
*100945*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s120_020_son:50-450]]
Help!
*100946*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s120a_001_son:0-960]]
They came back.
*100947*
[[S:::2433-2586]]
Th-
*100948*
[[S:::3312-4378]]
they came b-back…
*100949*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s120a_001_son_a:20-980]]
They came back.
*100950*
[[S:::1940-2210]]
Th-
*100951*
[[S:::3930-5300]]
they came b-back…
*100952*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s120a_010_kra:110-750]]
It is finished.
*100953*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s120a_020_son:0-750]]
I want to leave here.
*100954*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s120a_030_kra:90-1160]]
Then collect yourself.
*100955*
[[S:::1820-3000]]
We must find a way out.
*100956*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s120a_040_kra:0-1500]]
There is always a way out…
*100957*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s120a_050_kra:78-768]]
That chain…
*100958*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s120a_060_kra:23-408]]
Here.
*100959*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s120a_070_kra:0-750]]
Go drop the chain.
*100960*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s120a_080_son:11-405]]
Okay.
*100961*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s120a_090_kra:120-1500]]
Find something to pull me up.
*100962*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s120a_100_son:30-350]]
Okay.
*100963*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s120b_010_kra:0-640]]
Atreus…
*100964*
[[S:::1290-1750]]
the chain.
*100965*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s120b_020_son:0-1480]]
The chain, right.
*100966*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s120b_030_kra:0-1430]]
You are in your head, boy.
*100967*
[[S:::1990-2870]]
Let it go.
*100968*
[[S:::3780-4750]]
He would have killed you.
*100969*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s120b_040_son:0-1130]]
I know. I had to do it—
*100970*
[[S:::2200-3350]]
I do know that. I just…
*100971*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s120b_050_kra:19-1110]]
Then we will go home, boy.
*100972*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s120b_060_son:16-289]]
What?
*100973*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s120b_070_kra:0-1420]]
To give up this easily,
*100974*
[[S:::2090-3750]]
so close to the start…
*100975*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s120b_080_son:6-1013]]
Wait, no,
*100976*
[[S:::1258-3025]]
I’m not giving up.  I can do this.
*100977*
[[S:::3472-4137]]
I just have to…
*100978*
[[S:::4731-5257]]
you know…
*100979*

catch my breath.
*100980*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s120b_090_son:0-410]]
Come on up.
*100981*
[[S:::1230-1750]]
I’m ready.
*100982*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s120c_010_kra:50-1000]]
Listen to me…
*100983*
[[S:::1820-5650]]
To be effective in combat, a warrior must not feel for his enemy.
*100984*
[[S:::6440-8470]]
The road ahead is long and unforgiving…
*100985*
[[S:::9150-10500]]
no place for a boy.
*100986*
[[S:::11120-12700]]
You must be a warrior.
*100987*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s120c_020_son:63-858]]
I understand.
*100988*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_riv01_s128a_010_brk:90-2910]]
I’ll kick you square in the ringer, you don’t move it!
*100989*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_riv01_s128a_020_brk:120-1440]]
Whatcha waitin’ for?
*100990*
[[S:::2500-2800]]
C’mon already!
*100991*
[[S:::3520-4000]]
Let’s go!
*100992*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_riv01_s128a_030_brk:12-1893]]
C’moooooon!
*100993*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s129_020_son:0-1340]]
Trust me just this once.
*100994*
[[S:::1890-2250]]
Please?
*100995*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s129_030_son:1210-3010]]
The tree with the white trunk and orange leaves—right
*100996*
[[S:::3720-4970]]
there on the other side of the bridge.
*100997*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_riv01_s129_040_brk:0-1630]]
Why isn’t he throwing the axe?
*100998*
[[S:::2160-3500]]
He broken or somethin’?
*100999*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s129_050_son:40-1380]]
Are you going to throw the axe?
*101000*
[[S:::2080-2750]]
Into the trees?
*101001*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_riv01_s132_010_brk:44-4037]]
Well, don’t look now but our friend who was hiding in the trees is back for more!
*101002*
[[S:::4514-6659]]
Go on, give that axe a twirl!
*101003*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_riv01_s132_020_brk:147-4362]]
Well, don’t look now but our friends who were hiding in the trees are back for more!
*101004*
[[S:::4821-7064]]
Go on, give that axe a twirl!
*101005*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s132_030_son:29-1310]]
Got room for me behind there?
*101006*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_riv01_s132_040_brk:43-1705]]
So long as you don’t break nothing.
*101007*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_riv01_s132_050_brk:240-2250]]
Y’see?! See what my touch brung?
*101008*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s132_060_kra:85-738]]
Adequate!
*101009*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_riv01_s132_070_brk:40-5750]]
“Adequate” he says…! You know what’s adequate? That footwork. You step in shit?
*101010*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_riv01_s132_080_brk:0-2000]]
Oh, you’re in trouble now!
*101011*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_riv01_s132_090_brk:60-2350]]
Say, your pa can KILL.
*101012*
[[S:::2970-4500]]
You gonna learn to do that too?
*101013*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s132_100_son:17-852]]
I’m not sure…
*101014*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s132_110_kra:40-700]]
This road…
*101015*
[[S:::1190-2000]]
it leads to the mountain?
*101016*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_riv01_s132_120_brk:90-2430]]
Should put you in the right direction, sure.
*101017*
[[S:::2860-4250]]
Wanna see my wares again?
*101018*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s133_010_son:0-1712]]
Aw… I didn’t even see this here.
*101019*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s133a_010_kra:8-342]]
Come.
*101020*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s133a_020_son:9-3244]]
It was nice meeting you, Brok. I’ll be thinking of a name for your beast.
*101021*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_riv01_s133a_030_brk:0-1920]]
How ’bout I name her “fucking gratitude”?
*101022*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_riv01_s133a_040_brk:0-2750]]
Hey! Fucking Gratitude—come over here!
*101023*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_riv01_s133a_050_brk:14-837]]
I like it!
*101024*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_riv01_s134_010_brk:270-4750]]
Hey, watch your ’hinds in there! That place can bust you up real good.
*101025*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s134_020_son:0-1498]]
Uh…
*101026*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s134aa_010_kra:100-1500]]
You left me to fight alone.
*101027*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s134aa_020_son:0-470]]
I did.
*101028*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s134aa_030_kra:90-960]]
People are one thing.
*101029*
[[S:::1680-2970]]
Everything else, you fight…
*101030*
[[S:::3460-5660]]
until I say stop or we are dead.
*101031*
[[S:::6020-6650]]
Understand?
*101032*
[[S:::7570-8910]]
Pull your weight or we go home.
*101033*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s134aa_040_son:0-650]]
I understand.
*101034*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s134aa_050_kra:70-640]]
Good then.
*101035*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s134b_010_son:20-2195]]
Uh… that looks inviting.
*101036*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s134b_020_kra:0-440]]
This way.
*101037*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s134c_010_son:11-904]]
Machinery…

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s134c_020_son:18-980]]
Oooh…

Wait—what?

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s134c_040_son:5-1178]]
It’s sinking back down!
*101041*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s134c_050_son:10-1291]]
It’s coming back down again!
*101042*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s134c_060_son:22-866]]
Little close there…
*101043*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s134c_061_kra:61-725]]
Wait there.
*101044*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s134c_062_kra:45-785]]
Now, boy!

Ha-ha!

[[S:::970-1250]]
YES!
*101049*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s134c_070_son:6-1291]]
Wasn’t sure we were gonna get outta there…
*101050*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s134c_080_kra:0-1500]]
Trust I will not let us die.

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s134d_010_son:54-1611]]
Oooo… creepy.

Oh. We’re back here.
*101053*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s134d_030_kra:40-500]]
This way.
*101054*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s134a_010_son:0-3981]]
I’m happy we met Brok… but… I’m happier we’re leaving this place…
*101055*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s134a_020_kra:80-1000]]
It is behind us now.
*101056*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s125_010_son:0-570]]
Oh, wait…
*101057*
[[S:::1000-2000]]
we’re back here again.
*101058*

Hey, look at that!

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_020_son:30-714]]

Boy…
*101061*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_040_son:92-2175]]
Look, there are runes written along the side.
*101062*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_050_son:70-1250]]
Do you want me to read these runes?
*101063*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_060_kra:0-750]]
What does it say?
*101064*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_070_son:0-820]]
“As we are,

As I alone can never be.”
*101067*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_080_kra:60-400]]
A riddle?

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_090_son:66-2733]]
Hmmm… maybe there’s a clue around here.
*101069*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_100_kra:40-580]]
Boy,
*101070*
[[S:::1500-2500]]
what do those runes say?
*101071*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_110_son:0-740]]
It says “Family”…
*101072*
[[S:::1350-2290]]
what are we

[[S:::3270-4610]]
supposed to do with that?

Boy,

[[S:::1590-2750]]
what do those runes say?

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_112_son:24-640]]
Ooooh…
*101077*
[[S:::1030-1590]]
it says

[[S:::2170-2920]]
“Family”.
*101079*
[[S:::3690-4680]]
That’s not a clue.
*101080*
[[S:::5310-6090]]
It’s the answer!
*101081*
[[S:::6590-8580]]
What “I alone can never be” —
*101082*
[[S:::9540-9885]]
right?
*101083*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_114_son:0-820]]

*101086*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_113_kra_a:100-1170]]
What do the runes say?

A riddle?

Oh!
*101089*
[[S:::1330-3600]]
And “Family” must be the answer!
*101090*
[[S:::4420-6120]]
What “I alone can

[[S:::6960-7190]]
never be”—right?
*101092*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_120_kra:150-2250]]
Use your knife, and trace the runes into the sand.
*101093*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_130_son:22-512]]
Really?

Kynslóð…

Use your knife, and trace the runes into the sand.

It worked!

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_170_son:20-2129]]
Seems like maybe those rings should be turning.

The rings are turning! Come back down.
*101102*

Oh, bet you could freeze those gears, if you wanted to.

Not sure that’s it.

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_300_son:6-1839]]
Oop—now it’s wrong again.
*101115*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s136_310_son:42-1700]]
That’s it! I see runes!
*101116*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s137_010_kra:0-450]]
Boy,
*101117*
[[S:::900-1250]]
the stone.
*101118*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s137_020_son:35-508]]
Oh.
*101119*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s161_010_son:44-839]]
Wow…
*101120*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s163_010_kra:70-2000]]
Boy… I hear your animal ahead.
*101121*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s163_020_son:101-1239]]
I knew it was a boar!
*101122*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s170_010_son:0-1250]]
What’ll we do once we find it?
*101123*
[[S:::2150-4892]]
I drew to my chest like you said and it still didn’t pierce its hide.
*101124*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s170_020_kra:0-1638]]
You shot the animal’s flank.
*101125*
[[S:::1997-4581]]
Next time aim for the soft of its belly.
*101126*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s170_030_son:0-500]]
I understand.
*101127*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s180_010_kra:0-750]]
Stay alert.
*101128*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s180_011_son:0-930]]
More of those people?
*101129*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s180_012_kra:0-750]]
Something else.
*101130*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s180_013_son:0-2099]]
Some of the bodies are those weird dead things.
*101131*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s180_020_son:125-3319]]
There’s Draugr here too. They must have been fighting?
*101132*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s180_030_son:6-280]]
Ready?
*101133*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s185_010_son:38-1201]]
AHH! Another one!
*101134*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s190_010_son:31-1713]]
Look! It squeezed under that pillar!
*101135*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s190_020_kra:110-490]]
Here.
*101136*
[[S:::1000-1710]]
It ran under.
*101137*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s200_010_kra:0-542]]
Boy?!
*101138*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s200_020_son:18-980]]
He’s slowing down!
*101139*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s200_030_kra:0-750]]
Where are you?
*101140*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s200_040_kra:15-621]]
Boy!
*101141*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s200_041_son:11-876]]
Hurry, father!
*101142*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s200_042_kra:6-669]]
Atreus!
*101143*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s200_050_son:5-944]]
I found him!
*101144*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s200_060_kra:0-500]]
Wait, boy!
*101145*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s200_070_kra:0-509]]
Boy?
*101146*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s200_071_son:30-779]]
Please hurry!
*101147*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s200_080_son:12-775]]
Where are you?
*101148*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s200_081_son:7-1277]]
Father, over here!
*101149*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s200_082_kra:0-1000]]
Wait for me, boy!
*101150*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s200_083_kra:41-748]]
Atreus?!
*101151*
[[S:UNKNOWN FEMALE:vo_lvl_riv01_s200_090_fre:12-1262]]
WHAT DID YOU DO?!?
*101152*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s200_100_son:140-927]]
I’m sorry!
*101153*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s200_110_kra:24-874]]
ATREUS!!
*101154*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_010_fre:0-1750]]
That bow’s a little big for you, isn’t it?
*101155*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_020_son:0-870]]
My mother made it for me.
*101156*
[[S:::1650-2546]]
Said I’d grow into it.
*101157*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_030_fre:0-1829]]
I’ve never seen you in these woods.
*101158*
[[S:::2500-4500]]
She must miss you being away from home.
*101159*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_040_son:0-506]]
She…
*101160*
[[S:::2130-2710]]
she’s dead.
*101161*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_050_son:4-1897]]
We’re taking her ashes to the highest peak in the realms.
*101162*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_060_fre:40-760]]
Ashes?
*101163*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_070_son:20-940]]
It was her last wish.
*101164*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_080_kra:6-482]]
Boy!
*101165*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_090_fre:0-495]]
I’m…
*101166*
[[S:::1450-2930]]
sorry for your loss.
*101167*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_091_fre:0-585]]
We’re here.
*101168*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_100_son:0-881]]
You live in a tree?
*101169*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_110_fre:0-980]]
Not in it—
*101170*
[[S:::1570-2550]]
below it.
*101171*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_115_fre:166-1118]]
Heimili!
*101172*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_120_son:20-499]]
Look!
*101173*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_130_fre:6-791]]
It’s alright.
*101174*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_131_son:6-714]]
Is he friendly?!
*101175*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_140_kra:70-865]]
Boy…
*101176*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_150_fre:0-1750]]
I promise you, he’s safe.
*101177*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_160_son:35-750]]
He won’t hurt anyone…
*101178*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s220_170_fre:0-448]]
Quickly.
*101179*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s220b_010_fre:0-640]]
The Lamb’s Cress… Please.
*101180*
[[S:::1230-1810]]
Time is critical.
*101182*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s220b_020_fre:0-3790]]
I beg you—without the Lamb’s Cress from the garden I won’t be able to save him.
*101183*
[[S:::4300-5000]]
Please hurry…!
*101184*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s220c_010_fre:0-990]]
Lamb’s Cress. Good.
*101185*
[[S:::1550-2750]]
Have you the Red Root as well?
*101186*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s220c_020_kra:130-1000]]
The boy is searching.
*101187*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s220c_030_fre:0-1140]]
Perhaps he could use help. Please,
*101188*
[[S:::1670-4000]]
the salve is nothing without both ingredients.
*101189*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s220c_040_kra:86-835]]
Hhhnnmm.
*101190*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s230_010_son:4-3141]]
I like her. I mean, she lives under a turtle!
*101191*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s230_020_kra:0-1640]]
You are too open with her.
*101192*
[[S:::2130-3750]]
We do not know if she can be trusted.
*101193*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s230_030_son:0-1174]]
She hasn’t tried to kill us.
*101194*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s230_040_kra:0-466]]
Yet.
*101195*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s230_050_son:0-3353]]
Can you help? I can’t quite… get it…
*101196*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s235_010_fre:440-1430]]
Red Root. Good.
*101197*
[[S:::1900-2750]]
Have you the Lamb’s Cress?
*101198*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s235_020_kra:40-495]]
No.
*101199*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s235_030_son:0-960]]
He stopped to help me.
*101200*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s235_040_fre:0-2500]]
Please, the salve is nothing without both ingredients.
*101201*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s240_010_fre:160-4030]]
This underground passage should put you back on your path to the mountain.
*101202*
[[S:::4680-5500]]
Just use the boat.
*101203*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s240_020_fre:150-540]]
Wait.
*101204*
[[S:::1190-1750]]
And take this…
*101205*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s240_030_fre:120-2980]]
You can use it to orient yourself and navigate the world.
*101206*
[[S:::3600-5750]]
It will always steer you towards your goals.
*101207*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s240_040_fre:200-3350]]
And if you care to cleanse this cavern of the Revenant who’ve overrun it,
*101208*
[[S:::4110-4970]]
you have my gratitude.
*101209*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s240_050_fre:171-405]]
Ætt!
*101210*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_010_son:47-683]]
How is he?
*101211*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_020_fre:0-1090]]
He needs rest… but I think
*101212*
[[S:::1470-2750]]
he’s out of danger.
*101213*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_030_son:50-750]]
Does he have a name?
*101214*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_040_fre:0-850]]
Hildisvíni.
*101215*
[[S:::1530-3250]]
He’s been a good friend for a long time.
*101216*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_050_son:60-1470]]
I’ve never seen a boar like him.
*101217*
[[S:::2750-4180]]
You said he was the last in the realm?
*101218*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_060_fre:0-1390]]
The last in this realm.
*101219*
[[S:::2030-3900]]
He’s from somewhere else entirely.
*101220*
[[S:::4550-8570]]
Back home he could take any form he liked… but since he came here,
*101221*
[[S:::9270-9750]]
he’s been… stuck.
*101222*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_070_son:20-750]]
Stuck as a boar?
*101223*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_080_fre:0-1010]]
Stuck in his mind.
*101224*
[[S:::1740-5670]]
His own true nature grows faint in his memory,
*101225*
[[S:::6300-8750]]
like a dream… while the illusion feels more real every passing day.
*101226*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_090_son:60-1250]]
Not sure I understand.
*101227*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_100_fre:60-770]]
To live… simply to live,
*101228*
[[S:::1230-5490]]
in your physical form,
*101229*
[[S:::5860-8510]]
day after day… it’s hard to resist believing you are your form.
*101230*
[[S:::8960-13560]]
In youth,
*101231*
[[S:::13920-15590]]
he might have had the strength to rebel… but Hildisvíni is very,
*101232*
[[S:::16470-17460]]
very old.
*101233*
[[S:::18090-20000]]
Without me to remind him of home—of himself—I fear the Boar is all that will remain.
*101234*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_110_son:0-420]]
Well,
*101235*
[[S:::1420-2750]]
I hope he finds his way home.
*101236*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv01_s245_120_fre:0-680]]
Thank you, child.
*101237*
[[S:::1410-2000]]
I do too.
*101238*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s246_010_son:88-919]]
I see a boat.
*101239*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s246b_010_kra:0-1250]]
Do not touch the water.
*101240*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s246b_020_son:0-489]]
Why?
*101241*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s246b_030_kra:50-1750]]
Do you know what is under the surface?
*101242*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s246b_040_son:0-340]]
No,
*101243*
[[S:::1220-2000]]
it’s pitch black.
*101244*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s246b_050_kra:95-1802]]
Then do not touch the water.
*101245*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s247_010_son:60-896]]
Isn’t that heavy?
*101246*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s247_020_kra:50-601]]
Yes.
*101247*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s247_030_son:60-1093]]
Doesn’t seem heavy…
*101248*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s247_040_kra:47-511]]
Here.
*101249*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s247b_010_son:0-440]]
Hey,
*101250*
[[S:::930-3130]]
I think I see another one of those bowls of
*101251*
[[S:::3930-5040]]
sand up there—that I drew the runes into?
*101252*
[[S:::5840-7000]]
Not sure how we reach it though.
*101253*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s247b_020_son:0-1400]]
Bet I could reach that with some help.
*101254*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s247b_030_son:0-2500]]
Okay, well, that’s way too far to jump.
*101255*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s247b_031_son:98-2795]]
Bring that block closer, and I’ll jump to it. Probably.
*101256*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s247b_040_son:0-750]]
This’ll be fun.
*101257*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s247b_050_son:70-350]]
Whoa!
*101258*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s247b_060_son:44-713]]
Almost there!
*101259*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s247b_070_son:50-2222]]
I can’t jump over with those wooden boards in the way…
*101260*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_010_son:0-360]]
Hey,
*101261*
[[S:::760-2340]]
I think I see another sand bowl up
*101262*
[[S:::3170-4270]]
there—that I drew the runes into?
*101263*
[[S:::5060-6250]]
Not sure how we reach it though.
*101264*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_020_son:83-2901]]
It is! It’s another one of those sand bowls.
*101265*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_030_son:60-2200]]
There are different runes written along the side of this one…
*101266*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_040_kra:0-750]]
What does it say?
*101267*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_050_son:50-720]]
Another riddle.
*101268*
[[S:::1630-2330]]
“Feed me not,
*101269*
[[S:::3000-3890]]
we both are doomed
*101271*
[[S:::6370-7250]]
all consumed.
*101272*
[[S:::9280-9634]]
” Hmmm…
*101273*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_060_kra:80-1260]]
The answer might be near,
*101274*
[[S:::1720-2250]]
like the other.
*101275*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_080_son:4-2840]]
The answer’s gotta be written around here somewhere, right?
*101276*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_090_son:0-426]]
Wait,
*101277*
[[S:::900-2435]]
I think I see something on the ceiling.
*101278*
[[S:::3298-4982]]
But it’s blocked by those wooden boards.
*101279*
[[S:::5902-6395]]
See there?
*101280*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_110_son:69-1640]]
Ha! I see it now!
*101281*
[[S:::2030-2930]]
It says “Fire.
*101282*
[[S:::3490-4070]]
” Of course…
*101283*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_120_kra:0-1250]]
Draw the runes in the sand.
*101284*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_130_son:40-260]]
Okay,
*101285*
[[S:::610-940]]
wait.
*101286*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_140_son:52-598]]
Bál
*101287*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_150_son:60-350]]
Whoa! That did it..!
*101288*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_160_kra:0-750]]
Stay there!
*101289*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv01_s248_170_son:0-750]]
Come on over!
*101290*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv01_s160a_010_kra:80-2750]]
It is important for a warrior to keep his skills sharp.
*101291*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv02_s015_010_son:90-430]]
Wait… this
*101292*
[[S:::1000-1700]]
is wrong.
*101293*
[[S:::2160-2966]]
Where’s the sand bowl?
*101294*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv02_s015_020_kra:60-1069]]
The water dropped.
*101295*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv02_s015_030_son:80-2020]]
When the serpent rose. Right.
*101296*
[[S:::2690-3250]]
I knew that.
*101297*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv02_s020_010_son:260-520]]
Um,
*101298*
[[S:::1250-2380]]
so I was wondering…
*101299*
[[S:::3000-4250]]
why do you live under a turtle?
*101300*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_riv02_s020_020_fre:1870-4190]]
He was my first friend here in Midgard.
*101301*
[[S:::4660-10120]]
He offered me shelter, and in return, I provide him with protection against the evils of the forest.
*101302*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv02_s020_030_son:50-2120]]
Golden boar, giant turtle…
*101303*
[[S:::2720-4250]]
you sure have some interesting friends!
*101304*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv02_s020_040_son:50-890]]
See you later!
*101305*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_riv02_s020_050_fre:7-759]]
Be safe.
*101306*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv02_s030_010_son:25-1678]]
Can we get out of this place?
*101307*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv02_s030_010_son_a:49-1376]]
Can we get out of this place?
*101308*
[[S::vo_lvl_fthl01_s185_010_son_stem:6020-6660]]
Whoa…
*101309*
[[S:::7410-8680]]
Sure is foggy here.
*101310*
[[S:::14800-15690]]
Another dwarf,
*101311*
[[S:::16260-16950]]
should we—?
*101312*
[[S:::53640-54820]]
It was my mother’s.
*101313*
[[S:::56270-57980]]
She left it to father before she died.
*101314*
[[S:::85350-85770]]
But…
*101315*
[[S:::86790-88150]]
nobody asked you to…
*101316*
[[S:::101150-103810]]
I knew it! You are Brok’s brother!
*101317*
[[S:::104800-106180]]
The other half of the brand’s here…
*101318*
[[S:::160230-161420]]
So what were you working on?
*101319*
[[S:::172390-173350]]
And you know how to fix it?
*101320*
[[S::vo_lvl_fthl01_s185_010_sin_stem:20660-25080]]
Excuse me, but… how did you come by that axe?
*101321*
[[S:::27030-31000]]
And while I won’t dispute that… I know that blade.
*101322*
[[S:::31000-35340]]
It was one of ours. But we didn’t make it for you.
*101323*
[[S:::38090-44360]]
I can’t. See, the woman we made it for… I was, well… I am… quite fond of her.
*101324*
[[S:::44360-51360]]
And I would be somewhat… displeased if it turns out that… you did something to her.
*101325*
[[S:::62360-63320]]
Faye’s dead?
*101326*
[[S:::66050-68040]]
I’m… very, very sorry to hear that.
*101327*
[[S:::70690-74510]]
She was a fierce warrior… and a good woman.
*101328*
[[S:::79510-84180]]
Okay… I will make improvements to the axe.
*101329*
[[S:::89690-96430]]
Well, it’s true, but… But knowing your mother, she would have insisted I repair that act of vandalism
*101330*
[[S:::96430-101080]]
perpetrated against her axe by my brother.
*101331*
[[S:::112260-118960]]
Yes, though my talents are vastly superior. No boast—swear to Freya.
*101332*
[[S:::131760-137000]]
Yeeeah… but can you put it down over there?
*101333*
[[S:::137800-139720]]
That handle is filthy…
*101334*
[[S:::141300-146080]]
Okay, then… I’ll just… I will just…
*101335*
[[S:::157040-159550]]
Ugh… is that dried blood?
*101336*
[[S:::162100-168820]]
Oh, that… I call it the “Sky Mover.” Just up that mountain waits a treasure trove of rare resources.
*101337*
[[S:::168820-172200]]
Once I mine it, I’ll need a way to bring it all down…
*101338*
[[S:::174080-175380]]
Not even a little.
*101339*
[[S::vo_lvl_fthl01_s185_010_kra_stem:16630-17210]]
No.
*101340*
[[S:::17900-19380]]
He is of no consequence.
*101341*
[[S:::25010-26430]]
That is my concern alone.
*101342*
[[S:::36460-37430]]
Step aside.
*101343*
[[S:::109020-110950]]
The blue one is your brother?
*101344*
[[S:::125740-129000]]
Do not undo his work. Improve upon it only.
*101345*
[[S:::137000-137720]]
No.
*101346*
[[S::vo_lvl_fthl01_s187_010_son_stem:16846-18461]]
Let him GO!
*101347*
[[S:::29432-31026]]
RAHHHH!!!
*101348*
[[S:::41267-41983]]
Father…
*101349*
[[S::vo_lvl_fthl01_s187_010_kra_stem:23459-25593]]
AAAAARRGH!
*101350*
[[S:::59303-60962]]
Ready yourself.
*101351*
[[S::vo_lvl_fthl01_s190_010_kra_stem:3110-4110]]
Stay back, boy.
*101352*
[[S:::8570-9930]]
We must find another way up.
*101353*
[[S:::26760-27890]]
Why wait to warn us?
*101354*
[[S:::33280-33975]]
Mm.
*101355*
[[S:::55720-57061]]
Why help us?
*101356*
[[S:::82135-83229]]
Where must we go?
*101357*
[[S:::89318-90037]]
Rrrrn.
*101358*
[[S::vo_lvl_fthl01_s190_010_son_stem:4403-6956]]
Ugh…. what IS that?
*101359*
[[S:::11264-15511]]
The witch. Wish she was here. I bet she could get us past this.
*101360*
[[S:::22609-23600]]
What are you doing here?
*101361*
[[S:::49666-50447]]
It’s everything.
*101362*
[[S:::73708-75006]]
Even though we shot your friend?
*101363*
[[S::vo_lvl_fthl01_s190_010_fre_stem:16070-19860]]
My magic is useless against the Black Breath, and there’s no way around it.
*101364*
[[S:::20360-22090]]
Odin saw to that long ago.
*101365*
[[S:::23710-25650]]
Making sure you can finish your journey.
*101366*
[[S:::28410-31630]]
I was busy saving my friend, if you remember…
*101367*
[[S:::34510-39033]]
The Black Breath is a corruption of magic even I can’t dispel.
*101368*
[[S:::39493-43202]]
Only the pure Light of Alfheim is strong enough to break through it.
*101369*
[[S:::44236-45436]]
But that road is long.
*101370*
[[S:::46194-47765]]
What does this goal mean to you?
*101371*
[[S:::53103-53716]]
Follow me.
*101372*
[[S:::59552-63713]]
Maybe I see more of myself in you than I’m willing to admit. Maybe…
*101373*
[[S:::66177-68642]]
maybe by helping you, I’ll make up for a lifetime of mistakes.
*101374*
[[S:::71330-72763]]
Or maybe I just like you.
*101375*
[[S:::76634-78882]]
Even though you shot my friend, yes.
*101376*
[[S:::85193-87444]]
To a realm beyond your own…
*101377*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_fthl01_s012_010_sin:79-2173]]
Awww!  I just cleaned that!
*101378*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s015_010_son:0-2250]]
You think all dwarves are as weird as Brok and Sindri?
*101379*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s015_020_kra:0-250]]
No.
*101380*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s015_030_son:114-3184]]
Wonder why they don’t get along anymore. I mean, they’re family…
*101381*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s015_040_kra:230-1750]]
That is their matter alone, boy.
*101382*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s015_050_son:11-406]]
Okay.
*101383*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_fthl01_s020_010_sin:0-2593]]
Please be careful! I’m still fixing that!
*101384*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_fthl01_s020_020_sin:20-1300]]
Stupid head sheave.
*101385*
[[S:::1700-2750]]
Tell me what’s wrong with you!
*101386*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s025_010_son:54-2431]]
I can’t tell… Are we getting closer to the mountain?
*101387*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s025_020_kra:70-500]]
We are.
*101388*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s026_010_son:163-1042]]
The revenant again!
*101389*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s026_020_son:50-1250]]
This place really is cursed.
*101390*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s030_080_kra:0-450]]
There.
*101391*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s030_090_son:60-2359]]
She really didn’t want anyone to open that, huh?
*101392*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s030_100_son:90-1680]]
But why let a deadly curse stop you?
*101393*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s032_010_kra:0-960]]
Above the entrance…
*101394*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s032_020_son:80-2250]]
It’s a warning. You sure this is the way?
*101395*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s032_030_kra:50-750]]
I am sure.
*101396*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s035_010_son:0-2230]]
Do you think for this last leg up the mountain that
*101397*
[[S:::2750-3940]]
maybe I can carry her?
*101398*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s035_020_kra:30-1000]]
I told you, no.
*101399*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s035_030_son:40-482]]
Why?
*101400*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s035_040_son:70-1500]]
She meant more to me than you anyway.
*101401*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s035_050_kra:25-349]]
What?
*101402*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s035_060_son:70-860]]
I just meant…
*101403*
[[S:::1380-3970]]
I spent more time with her. You were off hunting a lot.
*101404*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s035_070_kra:40-2000]]
It would serve you to stop talking.
*101405*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s037_010_son:120-620]]
An Ogre?!
*101406*
[[S:::1300-1900]]
Here?
*101407*
[[S:::2300-3378]]
Who built this place?
*101408*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s040_010_son:90-760]]
Whoa…
*101409*
[[S:::1150-3000]]
I can see why Mom wanted us to bring her here.
*101410*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s040_020_kra:80-650]]
Indeed.
*101411*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s045_010_son:100-3250]]
Wonder if Sindri knows his “Sky Mover” is tangled with roots up here?
*101412*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s045_020_kra:61-881]]
I doubt it.
*101413*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s045_030_son:55-1399]]
So how’s he going to get it to work?
*101414*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s045_040_kra:9-1120]]
I do not care.
*101415*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s050_010_son:91-1207]]
Is that… smoke?
*101416*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s060_010_son:119-2349]]
We’re going to another realm?! Are you coming with us?
*101417*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s060_020_kra:0-1250]]
Only for a little while.
*101418*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s060_030_fre:0-1500]]
Only for a little while.
*101419*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s080_010_fre:0-1080]]
We’ll use this.
*101420*
[[S:::2490-2750]]
Greiða!
*101421*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s080_020_son:70-1420]]
Can’t. Sindri said it was broken.
*101422*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s080_030_fre:10-586]]
Sindri?
*101423*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s080_040_kra:67-1856]]
The dwarf at the foot of these hills.
*101424*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s080_050_son:53-1474]]
He was fixing it when we got here.
*101425*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s080_060_fre:0-2980]]
No one was there when I passed by. Perhaps he finished?
*101426*
[[S:::3610-5250]]
Dwarves are awfully resourceful.
*101427*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s080_070_kra:90-2750]]
And irritating, based on the two we have met.
*101428*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s080_080_fre:1250-1750]]
That too.
*101429*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s090_010_fre:40-1000]]
Just give that a turn.
*101430*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s090_020_fre:0-1000]]
There. See?
*101431*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s100_010_fre:0-2170]]
Týr’s Temple is at the centre of the lake.
*101432*
[[S:::2900-5050]]
It is from there we travel to Alfheim.
*101433*
[[S:::5580-7500]]
Thankfully, it’s no longer under water.
*101434*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s100_020_kra:40-1500]]
Why is that creature in the bay?
*101435*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s100_030_fre:0-840]]
No one knows.
*101436*
[[S:::1440-2920]]
He just appeared one day.
*101437*
[[S:::3670-9250]]
Soon after, Thor attacked and their battle could be felt across all the realms.
*101438*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s100_040_fre:0-1920]]
Ultimately, it ended in a stalemate
*101439*
[[S:::2270-4540]]
and Thor returned to Odin empty-handed.
*101440*
[[S:::5280-10250]]
The Serpent stayed and grew so large he now spans all of Midgard.
*101441*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s100_050_son:60-1250]]
See! Told you…
*101442*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s100_060_fre:0-1490]]
They’ve hated each other ever since…
*101443*
[[S:::2060-4250]]
destined to kill each other come Ragnarok.
*101444*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s100_070_son:80-1250]]
You believe in Ragnarok?
*101445*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s100_080_fre:5-1534]]
I dearly wish I didn’t, child.
*101446*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s110_010_son:40-460]]
You know…
*101447*
[[S:::870-2500]]
we actually talked to the World Serpent.
*101448*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s110_020_fre:2-724]]
You did?
*101449*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl01_s110_030_kra:33-1093]]
An exaggeration.
*101450*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s110_040_son:157-3101]]
I’m good with languages… even ones I’ve never heard before.
*101451*
[[S:::3393-5912]]
But when he talks, I can’t understand any of it!
*101452*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_fthl01_s110_050_fre:25-1250]]
Sadly, no one can.
*101453*
[[S:::1620-3060]]
He speaks a dead tongue.
*101454*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s110_060_son:39-375]]
Oh.
*101455*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl01_s110_070_son:50-794]]
Must be lonely.
*101456*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl01_s180_010_son_stem:6650-7460]]
It reads:
*101457*
[[S:::7960-10740]]
“Sacrifice your arms to the centre of the water;”
*101458*
[[S:::11630-13400]]
awaken again the cradle of the world.
*101459*
[[S:::14760-15700]]
What…
*101460*
[[S:::16370-18060]]
throw our weapons into the water?
*101461*
[[S:::19140-20410]]
Guess that won’t be a problem for you.
*101462*
[[S:::23074-24620]]
Are you gonna do it?
*101463*
[[S:::57280-58260]]
Okay!
*101464*
[[S:::77770-79390]]
It’s the World Serpent…
*101465*
[[S:::97660-99870]]
I am! This is great…!
*101466*
[[S:::110620-112800]]
Yeah! Mom said he’s friendly!
*101467*
[[S:::114310-115500]]
I don’t know!
*101468*
[[S:::127690-130500]]
That… that was amazing…
*101469*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl01_s180_010_kra_stem:31552-33168]]
Mmm…
*101470*
[[S:::41110-42950]]
The axe did not return…
*101471*
[[S:::55870-56630]]
Hang on, boy!
*101472*
[[S:::68110-68830]]
What
*101473*
[[S:::69230-70190]]
is this?
*101474*
[[S:::95670-96870]]
Stay calm, boy!
*101475*
[[S:::108980-110171]]
It speaks?!
*101476*
[[S:::112700-114226]]
What is it saying?
*101477*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl01_s181_010_son_stem:3880-6600]]
Wait... there’s a shipwreck way over there. See that?
*101478*
[[S:::7950-11500]]
And there’s the statue of Thor. Except... I can see a lot more of him now.
*101479*
[[S:::15900-19000]]
Ooooh... that must be why that beach wasn’t there before. See?
*101480*
[[S:::20500-25200]]
And there’s the mountain! Lookit—that building leads from the foot of the mountain to that golden temple.
*101481*
[[S:::29200-34200]]
Except for the statue. Good thing, huh? There’s even a dock—there, next to the flag.
*101482*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl01_s181_010_kra_stem:12180-15220]]
The water dropped—when the serpent rose.
*101483*
[[S:::26780-28250]]
It was all just under the surface.
*101484*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl01_s182_010_son_stem:2106-3280]]
Is this the way to the mountain?
*101485*
[[S:::11860-12372]]
Brok?
*101486*
[[S:::14100-14988]]
But how did you—
*101487*
[[S:::24056-25178]]
Okay…
*101488*
[[S:::29544-30907]]
What do you think he wants?
*101489*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl01_s182_010_kra_stem:4021-5112]]
It would seem.
*101490*
[[S:::31069-32970]]
To test our patience.
*101491*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl01_s182_010_brk_stem:5481-11002]]
If it isn’t the bearded beefer and his sac-seed! Have I got something for you two…
*101492*
[[S:::15301-23247]]
None of yer fuckin’ business. Now get in here, I got something for ya! And don’t go makin’ pig eyes at my spot… I saw it first!
*101493*
[[S:::32968-37681]]
When word gets out about my new shop, folks’ll finally come outta hiding.
*101494*
[[S:::37868-42866]]
They’ll be clawing all over each other just to catch a whiff of my wares—you watch!
*101495*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s005_010_son:29-1543]]
Now we’ll get to that mountain quick.
*101496*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s005_020_son:134-3194]]
I just can’t believe I’m here, doing all this.
*101497*
[[S:::3590-5763]]
There was a time I thought I’d never leave our woods.
*101498*
[[S:::6193-7756]]
Or even my own bed sometimes.
*101499*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s005_030_kra:140-1898]]
You were not to blame for your sickness.
*101500*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s005_040_son:0-680]]
Oh, I know.
*101501*
[[S:::1210-2200]]
I guess I’m just saying…
*101502*
[[S:::2780-3500]]
this is great.
*101503*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s008_010_son:85-2463]]
There’s the mountain! Look how close we are.
*101504*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s008_020_kra:0-1450]]
We flow into sea water.
*101505*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s008_030_son:0-580]]
How do you know?
*101506*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s008_040_kra:0-1000]]
Do you not smell it?
*101507*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s008_050_son:0-1340]]
If that smell is the sea,
*101508*
[[S:::3110-4000]]
the sea stinks.
*101509*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s015_010_son:11-1824]]
Look at that. It’s Thor…
*101510*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s015_020_kra:40-640]]
Thor…
*101511*
[[S:::1460-2460]]
God of Thunder…
*101512*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s015_030_son:33-3700]]
That’s right! I never thought you listened when mother spoke of the gods.
*101513*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s015_040_kra:30-1210]]
I seldom did.
*101514*
[[S:::1910-3750]]
Did she speak of one who could feel no pain?
*101515*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s015_050_son:100-500]]
Oh—
*101516*
[[S:::1690-2750]]
that sounds like Baldur.
*101517*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s015_060_kra:0-500]]
Baldur…
*101518*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s015_070_son:60-850]]
An Aesir god.
*101519*
[[S:::1210-2250]]
Son of Odin and Frigg.
*101520*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s015_080_kra:24-1605]]
And Odin is king…
*101521*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s015_090_son:14-2520]]
That’s right. Why do you ask?
*101522*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s020_010_son:0-1640]]
I think I see something… just sitting
*101523*
[[S:::2180-3500]]
there in the middle of the lake.
*101524*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s020_031_son:0-1000]]
It’s some kind of statue.
*101525*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s020_040_son:30-2250]]
I see runes there, on his chest.
*101526*
[[S:::3010-4250]]
Can’t quite make it out.
*101527*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s020_050_son:0-1750]]
Maybe if we got closer to the statue?
*101528*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s030_010_son:64-5223]]
We’re going to the dock first, right? We’ll be the first people to walk on it in who knows how long!
*101529*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s030_020_kra:0-1250]]
You know of that serpent?
*101530*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s030_030_son:0-1020]]
He’s one of the Giants—
*101531*
[[S:::1440-5243]]
and he’s so big he’s wrapped around the whole world and bites his own tail.
*101532*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s030_040_kra:0-1000]]
An exaggeration.
*101533*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s030_050_son:20-500]]
I dunno…
*101534*
[[S:::950-2000]]
looked pretty big to me.
*101535*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s035_010_son:20-410]]
Oh, good. I was hoping we might explore a little.
*101537*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s035_020_kra:60-1930]]
When we wish to continue our journey,
*101538*
[[S:::2340-3470]]
we know to return here.
*101539*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s032_010_son:24-1318]]
How long you think this has been here?
*101540*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s032_020_kra:0-1250]]
A very long time…
*101541*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl01_s033_010_brk:0-2500]]
You rush around like that everywhere? Yeesh.
*101542*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl01_s033_020_brk:19-3207]]
C’mere already! You’re gonna be real happy.
*101543*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s033_030_son:0-600]]
Wait—
*101544*
[[S:::860-1870]]
aren’t we talking to Brok?
*101545*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s033_080_son:0-1000]]
Yeah, I don’t see us wanting that.
*101546*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl01_s033_090_brk:840-1890]]
Good! You want a job? When you’re done gawkin’,
*101547*
[[S:::2400-5140]]
I got a job for you.
*101548*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl01_s033_010_brk_stem:620-1390]]
Catch!
*101549*
[[S:::2990-4470]]
The pile of rocks there—
*101550*
[[S:::5130-10950]]
with that Key of Yggdrasil, you can open a magic door to the branches of the World Tree—
*101551*
[[S:::11330-13520]]
a shortcut ’tween the realms.
*101552*
[[S:::14068-18754]]
If y’ever see ’em out in the world, use it to get back to me quick.
*101553*
[[S:::19119-20901]]
But it’s only one-way—
*101554*
[[S:::21201-23489]]
straight back here and nowhere else.
*101555*
[[S:::23579-34540]]
And whatever you do, never, never, EVER, never, ever, ever, ever, ever throw yourself over the edge of the path… lest you want death.
*101556*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s036_010_son:0-2010]]
Looks like the same person as the big statue.
*101557*
[[S:::2490-3310]]
Must be a god.
*101558*
[[S:::3800-4250]]
Or a king?
*101559*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s045_010_son:160-700]]
Soooo… we can either keep heading
*101560*
[[S:::1600-3570]]
towards the mountain
*101561*
[[S:::4120-6110]]
or break off and do that favour for Brok.
*101562*
[[S:::7110-7750]]
What do you wanna do?
*101563*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s055_010_son:25-3677]]
We’re back in the boat. So I guess we are helping Brok?
*101564*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s055_020_kra:50-2680]]
When the water dropped, new beaches were exposed.
*101565*
[[S:::3180-4750]]
We should search them for resources.
*101566*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s055_030_son:0-350]]
Oh.
*101567*
[[S:::850-1620]]
That sounds good too!
*101568*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_011_son:38-1077]]
What is this?
*101569*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_012_kra:0-810]]
A horn.
*101570*
[[S:::1600-2360]]
Here is the end.
*101571*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_013_son:0-830]]
Can we blow into it?
*101572*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_014_kra:0-1250]]
Without knowing the outcome?
*101573*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_015_son:40-2750]]
Well, we usually push every button and pull every lever we see!
*101574*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_016_kra:0-1400]]
Outcomes we can predict.
*101575*
[[S:::1950-2370]]
No,
*101576*
[[S:::2970-4110]]
this is something else.
*101577*
[[S:::5050-6750]]
We must develop your instincts.
*101578*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_070_son:40-750]]
I knew it!
*101579*
[[S:::1110-2250]]
We are blowing the horn…
*101580*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_080_kra:0-330]]
No.
*101581*
[[S:::1200-2500]]
We are testing your resolve.
*101582*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_090_son:0-860]]
I have resolve.
*101583*
[[S:::1690-2460]]
A bunch of it.
*101584*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_100_son:0-1810]]
I won’t blow into it if you don’t.
*101585*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_110_mmr:0-3359]]
I don’t think we should disturb Jörmungandr without some reason…
*101586*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_120_mmr:0-2000]]
There’s really no call for that at this point.
*101587*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_130_mmr:0-3250]]
The snake’s already in position, brother—nothing more to negotiate.
*101588*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_140_mmr:0-4750]]
He’s already agreed to let us look for my eye in his belly. Best get it over with.
*101589*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_150_mmr:0-2500]]
I think we’re better off letting the snake rest, brother.
*101590*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_160_son:0-1690]]
Yeah, you’re probably right.
*101591*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s060_170_son:1-559]]
Thank you!
*101592*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s065_010_kra:0-560]]
With luck,
*101593*
[[S:::990-2750]]
that tower leads through to the mountain.
*101594*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s065_020_son:22-463]]
I’m ready.
*101595*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s075_010_son:0-750]]
Just another boat.
*101596*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s078_001_son:2-670]]
Uh… okay,
*101597*
[[S:::1350-2097]]
what is
*101598*
[[S:::2919-3606]]
that?
*101599*
[[S:::4644-5442]]
Is that a wall?
*101600*
[[S:::6053-7015]]
Made out of… what
*101601*
[[S:::8067-8973]]
are those?
*101602*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s078_002_kra:4-649]]
Scales.
*101603*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s078_003_son:0-820]]
Scales?
*101604*
[[S:::1460-2750]]
Why do they look like scales?
*101605*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s078_004_son:7-774]]
Don’t answer that.
*101606*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s078_010_son:37-3151]]
The World Serpent’s even over here! I told you he’s big.
*101607*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s078_020_son:88-3097]]
I wonder if the World Serpent even knows part of his body’s laying over here.
*101608*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s085_010_son:13-681]]
Ohhh…
*101609*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s090_010_son:40-1040]]
What is that?
*101610*
[[S:::1420-2250]]
Smells awful…
*101611*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s090_020_kra:25-786]]
Poison…
*101612*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s110_010_son:950-2200]]
What were those things?
*101613*
[[S:::2590-3620]]
They smelled awful.
*101614*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s110_020_kra:40-1940]]
Your mother called them “scorn poles.”
*101615*
[[S:::2560-3510]]
Poison magic.
*101616*
[[S:::4160-6430]]
She was the one who showed me how to disable them.
*101617*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s110_030_son:20-1079]]
(chuckles)
*101618*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s110_040_kra:13-361]]
What?
*101619*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl01_s110_050_son:17-2294]]
It’s just funny to think of her teaching you something.
*101620*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl01_s110_060_kra:22-621]]
Yes.
*101621*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s210_010_fre_stem:16830-18510]]
Welcome to Alfheim, gentlemen.
*101622*
[[S:::20160-21070]]
Think you can… spot…
*101623*
[[S:::22860-23380]]
The light.
*101624*
[[S:::24200-25060]]
I can barely see it.
*101625*
[[S:::26010-26780]]
Something’s wrong.
*101626*
[[S:::27280-29410]]
See that column of light on the horizon?
*101627*
[[S:::29850-31580]]
It’s housed in the heart of a ringed temple.
*101628*
[[S:::32040-33352]]
We’ll find what we need there.
*101629*
[[S:::34113-38000]]
No, no, no, no, no. Dammit, not yet…
*101630*
[[S:::41172-46407]]
To restore the Bifröst’s magic, you must step into The Light. But be very careful not to get caught up in the—
*101631*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s210_010_son_stem:38001-38490]]
What’s happening—?!
*101632*
[[S:::49240-50067]]
No!
*101633*
[[S:::55214-57099]]
She’s not dead, is she?
*101634*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s210_010_kra_stem:53351-54021]]
Hrrn.
*101635*
[[S:::58098-59263]]
Not likely.
*101636*
[[S:::59896-60687]]
Come.
*101637*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s220_010_son_stem:155-1834]]
AARGH!
*101638*
[[S:::5273-7645]]
Voices. You don’t hear that?
*101639*
[[S:::11350-12508]]
It’s going away now.
*101640*
[[S:::13119-14110]]
There was screaming.
*101641*
[[S:::15053-16501]]
Lots of voices… Angry.
*101642*
[[S:::18885-20839]]
You really didn’t hear that?
*101643*
[[S:::24670-27956]]
It felt… evil.
*101644*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s220_010_kra_stem:1950-2640]]
What is it, boy?
*101645*
[[S:::8160-8800]]
I hear nothing.
*101646*
[[S:::21530-22015]]
No.

[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s230a_010_son_stem:4250-4820]]
No!

Father!
*101649*

BOY!

[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s230b_010_kra_stem:37-5692]]
RAAAAAA!

[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s230c_010_kra_stem:1652-2529]]
Run, boy!
*101652*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s235_010_son_stem:1140-1700]]
Father!
*101653*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s235_010_kra_stem:3830-4660]]
Quiet!
*101654*
[[S:::5150-5770]]
I have him.
*101655*
[[S:::6410-7160]]
Your knife boy!
*101656*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s236_010_son_stem:1530-2420]]
Another one!
*101657*
[[S:::18010-18440]]
The light…
*101658*
[[S:::25270-25740]]
Got it.
*101659*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s236_010_kra_stem:2370-3000]]
Stay back!
*101660*
[[S:::18240-18855]]
Shhh!
*101661*
[[S:::20720-24912]]
Yes—we are near our goal. But we must be careful. Understand?
*101662*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s237_010_kra_stem:3900-4671]]
Jump, boy!
*101663*
[[S:::12570-13260]]
Here they come!
*101664*
[[S:::13700-15526]]
Stay behind me and protect our flank!
*101665*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s237_010_son_stem:4684-5251]]
Right!
*101666*
[[S:::7916-9014]]
Look out!
*101667*
[[S:::15877-16950]]
Yes, sir!
*101668*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s240a_010_kra_stem:5797-6835]]
Boy!
*101669*
[[S:::22815-24514]]
Are you injured?
*101670*
[[S:::73423-74857]]
Stay here.
*101671*
[[S:::75516-76746]]
Stay.
*101672*
[[S:::77145-78372]]
Here.
*101673*
[[S:::83227-86368]]
Only use it as a last resort.
*101674*
[[S:::90025-92646]]
I am letting you hold my axe.
*101675*
[[S:::94483-96253]]
It is not a gift.
*101676*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s240a_010_son_stem:24110-25682]]
I’m fine.
*101677*
[[S:::27320-28679]]
Wow…
*101678*
[[S:::28899-30008]]
It’s beautiful…
*101679*
[[S:::37534-41308]]
The light… it’s making the whole temple reappear.
*101680*
[[S:::41542-43125]]
It’s the source of all of it.
*101681*
[[S:::46999-50896]]
Wait—it’s… it’s singing.
*101682*
[[S:::51630-57274]]
I hear…I hear her. I told you I heard her! Do you think she’s in there?
*101683*
[[S:::58457-61043]]
Aah! Aah…
*101684*
[[S:::62298-66455]]
That really hurt. Felt like my hand was on fire.
*101685*
[[S:::75094-76494]]
But I want to go—
*101686*
[[S:::88704-91109]]
You’re giving me your axe?
*101687*
[[S:::97134-98272]]
Still…
*101688*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s240b_010_kra_stem:12880-13750]]
What is this—?
*101689*
[[S:::18385-18855]]
Faye?
*101690*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s242_010_kra_stem:3105-4263]]
Faye…
*101691*
[[S:::5885-6814]]
Wait!
*101692*
[[S:::7510-8483]]
Come back!!
*101693*
[[S:::9225-10890]]
NO!!!...NO!
*101694*
[[S:::11357-12519]]
What have you done?
*101695*
[[S:::12801-14087]]
Why did you do that?
*101696*
[[S:::20953-21965]]
Boy...
*101697*
[[S:::22483-23974]]
I was gone only...
*101698*
[[S:::29240-30363]]
moments…
*101699*
[[S:::43390-44440]]
I…
*101700*
[[S:::46201-47730]]
That’s impossible.
*101701*
[[S:::63763-64807]]
Yes.
*101702*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s242_010_son_stem:14396-20842]]
I saved you! You were trapped in there. I waited and I waited but you wouldn’t come out… So I pulled you out!
*101703*
[[S:::30696-35999]]
NO. You’ve been gone a long, long time!
*101704*
[[S:::36833-43041]]
I didn’t know what to do. You left me here. AGAIN. Why don’t you care?
*101705*
[[S:::51754-53291]]
We should go before they come back.
*101706*
[[S:::55156-56858]]
I hope you got what you needed.
*101707*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s243_010_kra_stem:890-1430]]
Boy…
*101708*
[[S:::1840-2440]]
your bow.
*101709*
[[S:::5050-5750]]
Hold it out.
*101710*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s247_010_son_stem:9581-10220]]
No.
*101711*
[[S:::10402-11451]]
That can’t be.
*101712*
[[S:::13139-15284]]
That we made a “grave mistake.”
*101713*
[[S:::19299-20667]]
Did we help the wrong side?
*101714*
[[S:::21831-23062]]
Let me guess…
*101715*
[[S:::23085-25754]]
you’re gonna be smug and say you told me we shouldn’t get involved.
*101716*
[[S:::27442-28513]]
Can we go now?
*101717*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s247_010_kra_stem:11750-12756]]
What did it say?
*101718*
[[S:::20820-21408]]
I—
*101719*
[[S:::26230-26790]]
That is enough!
*101720*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s250a_010_son_stem:1309-1902]]
So…
*101721*
[[S:::4134-4854]]
Was she in the light?
*101722*
[[S:::7668-8328]]
You know.
*101723*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s250a_010_kra_stem:6300-6710]]
Who.
*101724*
[[S:::10530-10960]]
No.
*101725*
[[S:::11510-12250]]
She was not there.
*101726*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s250_010_son_stem:1862-4027]]
Not like you would even care if she was…
*101727*
[[S:::24386-25363]]
I’m sorry…
*101728*
[[S:::27302-28446]]
I didn’t realise…
*101729*
[[S::vo_lvl_alf01_s250_010_kra_stem:3981-5650]]
Mind your tongue, boy!
*101730*
[[S:::6460-10073]]
Until our journey is over, one of us must remain focused.
*101731*
[[S:::10700-13630]]
Do not mistake my silence for lack of grief!
*101732*
[[S:::15340-16590]]
Mourn how you wish,
*101733*
[[S:::17450-19258]]
leave me to my own.
*101734*
[[S:::29510-30321]]
No...
*101735*
[[S:::31150-32324]]
Why would you?
*101736*
[[S:::33970-35574]]
You do not know my ways.
*101737*
[[S:::38264-40207]]
I know it has not been easy.
*101738*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s015_010_son:100-1000]]
Look at this place…
*101739*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s015_020_kra:20-1050]]
Stay by me,
*101740*
[[S:::1480-2250]]
touch nothing.
*101741*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s015_030_son:90-1290]]
She’s probably not coming back,
*101742*
[[S:::1820-2250]]
is she?
*101743*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s015_040_son:30-2390]]
The witch told us to head for that giant light shaft out there.
*101744*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s030_010_son:50-810]]
Okay—what
*101745*
[[S:::1260-1880]]
is that?
*101746*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s030_020_son:12-1123]]
That stuff’s strong…
*101747*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s030_030_son:49-1742]]
Is there something glowing inside that knot?
*101748*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s030_040_son:250-1380]]
I think you killed it.
*101749*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s030_050_son:0-2500]]
Another one… and look! A Light Elf on that ridge!
*101750*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s050_010_son:38-467]]
Whoa…
*101751*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s050_020_son:41-787]]
What’s that about?
*101752*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s050_030_kra:70-2500]]
Not our concern, boy. Focus.
*101753*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s055_010_son:70-2000]]
What are they attacking us for? We didn’t do anything.
*101754*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s055_020_kra:125-2036]]
Hmph. More will come.
*101755*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s060_020_son:17-649]]
What’re you doing?
*101756*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s060_030_son:0-1080]]
Oh—a coffin!
*101757*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s070_010_son:32-803]]
Did you say something?
*101758*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s070_020_kra:0-550]]
No.
*101759*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s070_030_son:29-833]]
Oh.  Okay.
*101760*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s075_010_kra:0-750]]
Can you read this?
*101761*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s075_020_son:42-6689]]
Hm… something about an “eternal war for the light.” I don’t get it—if both sides need it, why not just share it?
*101763*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s075_030_kra:0-670]]
Greed.
*101764*
[[S:::1190-3250]]
You will find it a common cause for war.
*101765*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s075_040_kra:0-922]]
What does it say?
*101766*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s075_050_son:16-4889]]
It’s about the “eternal war for the light.” Do you think it’ll stop now after what we did?
*101767*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s075_060_kra:13-813]]
Unlikely.
*101768*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_alf01_s425_010_sin:40-470]]
You’re back!
*101769*
[[S:::1130-2000]]
I see you’ve been busy.
*101770*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s425_020_kra:0-1000]]
How observant.
*101771*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_alf01_s425_030_sin:0-2410]]
I am known for my attention to detail.
*101772*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s080_010_son:114-2695]]
Ugh… Where’s this stuff even come from?
*101773*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s080_020_son:1060-1460]]
Uh… wait…
*101774*
[[S:::2020-2500]]
so…
*101775*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s080_030_son:0-1190]]
You’re really close…
*101776*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s080_040_son:75-591]]
Yeah!
*101777*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s090_010_son:0-750]]
Another dead one.
*101778*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s091_010_son:60-1767]]
At least we’re getting closer to the light.
*101779*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s100_010_son:73-326]]
Look—
*101780*
[[S:::611-1820]]
there’s a boat tangled up over there.
*101781*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s100_011_son:83-1228]]
Wait… is that Sindri?
*101782*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s100_020_son:33-723]]
Boat’s free!
*101783*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s120_010_son:53-662]]
What’d you say?
*101784*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s120_020_kra:70-1123]]
I said nothing.
*101785*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s120_030_son:0-560]]
Really?
*101786*
[[S:::1110-1750]]
Okay…
*101787*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s125_010_kra:180-1750]]
Did your mother speak of this realm?
*101788*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s125_020_son:0-660]]
Not much.
*101789*
[[S:::2090-4210]]
Just that since the Elves were always fighting over the Light,
*101790*
[[S:::5350-6250]]
it kept them isolated.
*101791*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s111_020_son:22-345]]
Huh?
*101792*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s111_020_kra:80-590]]
Again,
*101793*
[[S:::1070-1750]]
I said nothing.
*101794*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s111_030_son:33-1813]]
Weird. Could have sworn you said some—
*101795*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s110_010_son:84-1917]]
Look. Should we try talking to them?
*101796*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s110_020_kra:30-250]]
No.
*101797*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s110_030_son:64-1043]]
But maybe they need help.
*101798*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s110_040_kra:110-3000]]
They do not stop us, so they do not concern us.
*101799*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s110_050_son:450-1050]]
But maybe—
*101800*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s110_060_kra:40-1750]]
They do not concern us.
*101801*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s130_010_son:40-2865]]
Look at that… that must be the ringed temple.
*101802*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s135_010_son:210-2049]]
Look, they have sand bowls in Alfheim too!
*101803*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s135_020_son:0-500]]
Should I read it?
*101804*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s135_030_kra:30-750]]
What does it ask?
*101805*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s135_040_son:0-2990]]
“Without me or within me death is sure /
*101806*
[[S:::3370-6310]]
Yet within you I am life most pure.
*101807*
[[S:::7270-9250]]
But… I don’t see any runes around here.”
*101808*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s135_050_kra:630-1530]]
We must find it.
*101809*
[[S:::1930-2750]]
Back to the boat.
*101810*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s135_060_kra:0-750]]
What does it ask?
*101811*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s135_070_son:40-2990]]
“Without me or within me death is sure /
*101812*
[[S:::3950-6870]]
Yet within you I am life most pure.”
*101813*
[[S:::8580-10000]]
Yep—it’s “water” all right.
*101814*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s135_080_son:70-770]]
I think you’re right.
*101815*
[[S:::1420-2300]]
The runes aren’t here.
*101816*
[[S:::3260-4610]]
Maybe we should head to the temple?
*101817*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s138_010_son:50-1700]]
They keep murdering the Light Elves.
*101818*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s138_010_son_a:60-1750]]
They keep murdering the Light Elves, what’s going on here?
*101819*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s138_020_kra:40-760]]
It is war…
*101820*
[[S:::1190-2020]]
the end of one.
*101821*
[[S:::2720-3750]]
The robed ones lost.
*101822*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s138_030_son:25-398]]
Oh.
*101823*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s138_040_kra:30-750]]
Be ready!
*101824*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s138_040_kra_a:40-750]]
Be ready!
*101825*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s140_031_son:0-470]]
Father…
*101826*
[[S:::1020-2279]]
I have a confession to make.
*101827*
[[S:::3080-4400]]
All those voices in my head…
*101828*
[[S:::5050-5290]]
well,
*101829*
[[S:::6210-7468]]
this wasn’t the first time.
*101830*
[[S:::8131-9336]]
Back when we met Brok…
*101831*
[[S:::9588-12259]]
his animal warned me about something hiding in the trees.
*101832*
[[S:::12566-13897]]
That’s why she didn’t want to cross.
*101833*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s140_040_kra:90-930]]
She told you?
*101834*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s140_050_son:0-2120]]
Well… I could just feel what she was feeling…
*101835*
[[S:::2550-3890]]
what she was afraid of.
*101836*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s140_060_kra:97-4159]]
Mmm. It happens again, you tell me. Understand?
*101837*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s140_070_son:0-500]]
I promise.
*101838*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s150_010_son:0-650]]
Aaah!
*101839*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s150_020_kra:65-560]]
Boy!
*101840*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s150_030_son:86-8072]]
It was the voices again… but different voices. Less angry. They were asking for help.
*101841*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s150_040_kra:0-3870]]
We are here for the Light. I do not care who they are nor what they want.
*101842*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s150_050_son:29-1313]]
You never care about anything…
*101843*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s150_060_kra:51-1308]]
You have something to say?
*101844*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s150_070_son:43-823]]
No…
*101845*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s160_010_son:49-3128]]
The blue door—that’s gotta be the entrance. Let’s go!
*101846*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s160_011_kra:30-750]]
Careful, boy.
*101847*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s160_020_son:52-830]]
What are they doing?
*101848*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s160_021_son:90-3525]]
The bridge is gone. They covered the crystal with that stuff. Why?
*101849*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s160_030_kra:50-1480]]
To prevent reinforcements.
*101850*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s170_010_son:46-1819]]
Maybe we can fix the bridge from down there?
*101851*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s175_010_son:0-1360]]
What is their problem with us?
*101852*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s175_020_kra:50-1250]]
We do not belong here.
*101853*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s180_010_son:0-1640]]
Okay, so that did something…
*101854*
[[S:::2080-2500]]
I think?
*101855*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s180_020_son:50-3250]]
Wait. Combined together like that… they kind of look like a rune.
*101856*
[[S:::3885-5476]]
But it doesn’t make sense…
*101857*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s180_030_kra:0-1500]]
Come. Back to the sand bowl.
*101858*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s180_040_kra:50-1250]]
Come. Back to the boat.
*101859*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s180_050_son:19-4908]]
Hmm. Don’t see anything else over here. Maybe we should check the sand bowl again?
*101860*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s195_010_son:60-560]]
Father!
*101861*
[[S:::1190-3160]]
The pillars and ring form an elvish rune!
*101862*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s195_020_kra:50-820]]
Do you know it?
*101863*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s195_030_son:50-1100]]
It means “water.
*101864*
[[S:::1560-2530]]
” Right… “life
*101865*
[[S:::3510-4830]]
most pure.
*101866*
[[S:::5430-6450]]
” And you die without it.
*101867*
[[S:::7550-8000]]
Clever.
*101868*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s195_031_kra:40-750]]
Do you know it?
*101869*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s195_040_son:0-1490]]
I’m pretty sure it means “water.” It’s gotta be tied to the sand bowl, right?
*101871*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s195_041_kra:40-680]]
Draw it.
*101872*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s195_050_son:0-250]]
Okay.
*101873*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s196_010_son:30-400]]
Lögr
*101874*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s196_020_son:46-689]]
What’s happening!?
*101875*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s196_030_son:53-1712]]
Woahhh… look what we found!
*101876*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s230_010_son:41-461]]
Father…
*101877*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s230_020_kra:30-402]]
Yes?
*101878*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s230_030_son:220-1710]]
The voices I heard,
*101879*
[[S:::2170-4490]]
I… it was hard to make out… but way in the
*101880*
[[S:::4960-6488]]
back I’m pretty sure I heard… mother.
*101881*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s230_040_kra:0-1250]]
That is not possible.
*101882*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s230_050_son:50-1170]]
But I know what I heard—
*101883*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s230_060_kra:0-1400]]
Atreus. Enough.
*101884*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s197_010_son:0-2320]]
He looks different.  Look at those horns.
*101885*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s197_020_kra:0-750]]
Behind me, boy.
*101886*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s197_030_son:48-951]]
That can’t be good.
*101887*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s198_010_kra:90-1500]]
Stay away from those cages.
*101888*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s198_020_son:90-1250]]
Wonder why they’re locked up.
*101889*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s199a_010_kra:60-750]]
Be ready.
*101890*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s199a_020_son:33-444]]
What?
*101891*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s199b_010_son:40-1513]]
Hope that was worth it.
*101892*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s200_010_son:50-1770]]
Look… another Nornir chest.
*101893*
[[S:::2430-4000]]
Let’s see… where are the seals?
*101894*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s205_010_son:110-710]]
Okay.
*101895*
[[S:::1610-2130]]
Tricky… very
*101896*
[[S:::2570-3500]]
tricky.
*101897*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s206_010_son:70-2000]]
Think that side hallway will get us to the temple?
*101898*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s206_020_kra:0-980]]
We will find out.
*101899*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s240_010_son:50-1000]]
You were wrong back there.
*101900*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s240_020_kra:0-550]]
Oh…?
*101901*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s240_030_son:60-1700]]
I know mother’s voice better than anyone.
*101902*
[[S:::2080-2500]]
It was her.
*101903*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s240_040_kra:30-3000]]
She is gone, boy. Speak no more of this.
*101904*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s240_050_son:21-730]]
Fine.
*101905*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s211a_010_son:70-2399]]
Get off him!
*101906*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s211a_020_son:95-1341]]
We didn’t do anything!
*101907*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s211a_030_son:83-1405]]
Let go of me!
*101908*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s211a_040_son:53-1158]]
Father, NO!!!
*101909*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s211b_010_son:0-789]]
Stay back!
*101910*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s211b_020_kra:127-1892]]
Hold on, boy! Fight!
*101911*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s211b_030_son:30-907]]
Father, hurry!
*101912*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s211b_040_son:64-954]]
Get away from me!
*101913*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s211b_050_son:45-1078]]
What do you want with us?!?
*101914*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s211b_060_son:81-1358]]
Don’t come any closer!
*101915*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s211c_010_son:146-2306]]
Thanks.
*101916*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s211c_020_kra:67-464]]
Mm.
*101917*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s212_010_son:90-1010]]
No way across here.
*101918*
[[S:::1530-3500]]
Too bad the witch’s bowstring doesn’t work anymore.
*101919*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s213_010_son:50-3090]]
Look—the blue temple door. We’re almost there.
*101920*
[[S:::3850-6190]]
But the bridge crystal’s still covered in that stuff…
*101921*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s215_010_son:30-1824]]
Hey, you sure the witch is okay?
*101922*
[[S:::2226-3917]]
I’d hate to think she died helping us.
*101923*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s215_020_kra:50-1250]]
She knew what she was doing.
*101924*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s215_030_son:40-350]]
Okay.
*101925*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s216_010_son:810-1360]]
Ugh! More of it.
*101926*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s216_020_kra:160-2610]]
If we cut enough away, the bridge above us should re-appear.
*101927*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s216_030_son:18-764]]
Riiight.
*101928*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s216_040_kra:0-1250]]
Expect resistance.
*101929*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s216_050_son:13-510]]
Right.
*101930*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s217a_010_son:20-2162]]
You’re freezing it first! Smart!
*101931*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s217_010_son:0-1000]]
Well, there it is…
*101932*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s217_020_kra:0-1000]]
Watch our backs, boy.
*101933*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s218_010_son:39-2152]]
That did it! We brought the main bridge back!
*101934*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s218_020_kra:0-1250]]
We must find a way up.
*101935*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s220_010_son:720-3990]]
Huh… guess the light makes more than bridges. Maybe this will spit us out on top.
*101936*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s231_010_son:24-2056]]
Look! The blue door! We made it.
*101937*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s232_010_son:0-2750]]
You know… I will never get used to walking on solid light.
*101938*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s232_020_kra:80-740]]
The door.
*101939*
[[S:::1180-2000]]
There is no seam.
*101940*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s232_030_son:22-408]]
What?
*101941*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s232_040_kra:60-1000]]
We have a problem.
*101942*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s235_010_kra:54-1745]]
These doors do not open.
*101943*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s235_020_son:15-563]]
Hello?
*101944*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s235_030_son:56-2081]]
I don’t get it. Why even have a door then?
*101945*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s235_040_son:82-1099]]
Hellooo?
*101946*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s235_050_kra:0-2190]]
Come. We will find another way in.
*101947*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s236_010_kra:20-1000]]
More of those bells.
*101948*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s236_020_son:40-1500]]
A Nornir chest must be nearby.
*101949*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s238_010_kra:24-1278]]
The dwarf again.
*101950*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s238_020_son:69-606]]
Sindri?
*101951*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s245_010_kra:34-570]]
This way.
*101952*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s245_020_son:50-2500]]
Hey… how did Sindri get ahead of us?
*101953*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s245_030_kra:100-2250]]
He and the blue one do seem to travel quickly.
*101954*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s245_040_son:21-413]]
Huh.
*101955*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s250_010_son:36-754]]
We’re inside.
*101956*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s256_010_son:27-1108]]
This place is great.
*101957*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s256_020_son:36-884]]
Of course.
*101958*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s260_010_son:60-3000]]
I bet it was beautiful here before the Dark Elves destroyed everything.
*101959*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s262_010_son:46-1396]]
Wonder what those are attached to.
*101960*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s262_020_son:34-775]]
Almost!
*101961*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s262_030_son:0-350]]
Nice.
*101962*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s263_010_son:0-790]]
Whoa.
*101963*
[[S:::1150-2500]]
Now that’s impressive.
*101964*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s264_010_son:0-1390]]
“From darkness… keep safe the light.
*101965*
[[S:::1800-2910]]
” Didn’t do a very good job,
*101966*
[[S:::3980-6215]]
did they?
*101967*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s265_010_kra:40-1273]]
There. The light.
*101968*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s265_020_son:40-3500]]
They’ve covered it up with that stuff… why would they do that?
*101969*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s270_010_son:80-520]]
Look…
*101970*
[[S:::1420-2250]]
another Light Elf.
*101971*
[[S:::3020-3528]]
What’s he doing?
*101972*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s270_020_son:90-500]]
Oh no.
*101973*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s270_030_son:0-2592]]
Why are they killing him? He didn’t do anything.
*101974*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s270_040_kra:30-1000]]
Do not assume.
*101975*
[[S:::1610-3650]]
You are seeing the end of a war, boy.
*101976*
[[S:::4040-5750]]
You do not know what led to this moment.
*101977*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s270_050_son:27-1569]]
But he didn’t even defend himself.
*101978*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s270_060_kra:170-1400]]
That was his choice.
*101979*
[[S:::1830-2750]]
We make ours.
*101980*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s273_010_son:35-518]]
What now?
*101981*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s273_020_kra:110-1150]]
The light is near.
*101982*
[[S:::1680-2750]]
Look for a way inside.
*101983*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s275_010_son:50-2250]]
Hey, some of the light is peeking out over here.
*101984*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s275_020_son:67-2404]]
That did it! Look—more light bridges.
*101985*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s275_030_kra:60-500]]
Follow me.
*101986*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s278_010_son:31-1333]]
You’re restoring all the pathways…
*101987*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s280_010_son:80-2737]]
Uh… I’m not too sure about this.
*101988*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s282_010_son:124-3550]]
Yeah… that looks too hard. Maybe we can find the light somewhere else…
*101989*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s282_020_kra:0-1500]]
No. Give me a moment.
*101990*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s282_021_son:0-360]]
See.
*101991*
[[S:::850-1530]]
It’s too hard.
*101992*
[[S:::1970-2650]]
We should go.
*101993*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s282_022_kra:0-500]]
Not yet.
*101994*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s282_023_son:85-2420]]
I don’t think you’re gonna get it. We should go.
*101995*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s282_024_kra:40-970]]
I will get it.
*101996*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s282_025_son:0-714]]
Now can we go?
*101997*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s282_026_kra:43-1243]]
I require silence.
*101998*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s282_030_son:19-549]]
Aawww…
*101999*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s282_040_son:27-1199]]
I mean—we’re in!
*102000*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s285_010_son:41-1865]]
I don’t think we’re supposed to be in here.
*102001*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s285_020_kra:38-601]]
Quiet.
*102002*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s290_010_son:44-723]]
Did you hear that?
*102003*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s290_020_kra:0-1750]]
Stay alert and by my side.
*102004*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s297_010_son:85-529]]
Hey…
*102005*
[[S:::1270-2492]]
when we make it to the light,

how do you think we get it into the Bifröst?
*102007*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s297_020_kra:90-1370]]
The witch said to step into it.
*102008*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s297_030_son:0-500]]
She did?
*102009*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s297_040_kra:40-1750]]
When she was ripped away from this realm.
*102010*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s297_050_son:100-1000]]
Oh. How’d I miss that?
*102011*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s297_060_kra:140-2500]]
You were more concerned with her safety than our goal.
*102012*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s297_070_son:23-1336]]
Is that—a bad thing?
*102013*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s297_080_kra:70-1460]]
If one prevents the other.

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s298_010_son:59-931]]
That was close.
*102015*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s295_010_kra:40-1250]]
Do not stray from me, boy.
*102016*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s295_020_son:48-1094]]
You don’t gotta tell me.

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s300_010_son:68-2572]]
Ecch. It’s so… sticky.
*102018*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s305_010_kra:40-2000]]
This structure… I see weaknesses.

There. When it falls, be ready.

Okay.

Okay!

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s321_031_kra:66-2008]]

*102027*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s321_033_kra:70-2500]]
There are many targets—you will not miss!

They’re everywhere!!

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s321_041_kra:150-2490]]

No.

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s330_010_son:90-1320]]
You have to come back.

[[S:::2490-3500]]
You left me here alone…

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s330_020_kra:26-867]]
Atreus?

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s330_030_son:37-1274]]
… alone with him.
*102041*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s330_040_son:50-1250]]
He always leaves.
*102042*
[[S:::1927-2812]]
He’s never here.
*102043*
[[S:::3681-5164]]
He doesn’t want me and he never will.
*102044*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s330_050_son:136-1889]]
I don’t know him and he doesn’t know me.
*102045*
[[S:::3586-4800]]
Doesn’t seem to want to.
*102046*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s330_060_son:23-1798]]
I’m strong. I’m smart.
*102047*
[[S:::2312-3495]]
I’m not what he thinks I am.
*102048*
[[S:::4102-5258]]
I know better.
*102049*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s330_070_son:70-1226]]
He doesn’t talk to me.
*102050*
[[S:::1979-2963]]
Doesn’t teach me.
*102051*
[[S:::3371-7275]]
It should have been him. Do you hear me? Him… not you.
*102052*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s330_080_son:0-560]]
Except…
*102053*
[[S:::3170-4010]]
I don’t mean that.
*102054*
[[S:::5490-6490]]
You know I love him.
*102055*
[[S:::7890-9080]]
I just wish he was better.
*102056*
[[S:::10910-12000]]
I know he can be.
*102057*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s330_090_son:0-940]]
So if he tries…
*102058*
[[S:::1810-2490]]
I’ll try.
*102059*
[[S:::4010-4870]]
But if he doesn’t…
*102060*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s330_100_son:0-860]]
… please come back.
*102061*
[[S:::1840-3250]]
I know you’re out there somewhere.
*102062*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s340_010_son:65-5886]]
Look! There’s our exit, but there’s no light to make a bridge. We’re trapped.
*102063*
[[S:::5886-7186]]
And the witch’s bowstring is useless.
*102064*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s351_010_kra:0-740]]
On my mark,
*102065*
[[S:::1090-2500]]
loose your arrow into the stone.
*102066*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s351_020_son:32-662]]
It worked…
*102067*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s351_030_kra:90-1500]]
We can now make our way back.
*102068*
[[S:::2310-2900]]
Come.
*102069*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s355_010_son:0-2050]]
My arrow can’t get through all that stuff covering it. 
*102070*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s355_020_son:49-3451]]
It’s still covered, so I don’t know what you think I can do here.
*102071*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s355_030_son:38-3863]]
I’ll keep shooting, but it’s not going to work if you don’t clear that stuff of it.
*102072*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s355_040_kra:64-877]]
Atreus…
*102073*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s355_050_son:0-680]]
Just saying…
*102074*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s355_060_son:53-3873]]
Finally. I’ll light the crystal if you find me an angle.
*102075*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s355_070_kra:56-3049]]
Rrrn… let us make our way back up.
*102076*

That stairway’s blocked.
*102077*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s363_010_son:0-1170]]
There’s a Light Crystal ahead—just laying there.
*102078*
[[S:::1640-2590]]
Maybe it’ll help us get out
*102079*
[[S:::3370-5500]]
of this stupid place.
*102080*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s370_010_son:0-1000]]

I just might.

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s392_010_son:0-910]]
Oh look.

[[S:::1370-3000]]
The blue door that’s not a door.
*102089*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s392_020_kra:0-1000]]
… and a sand bowl.
*102090*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s392_030_son:80-1850]]
But how do you expect me to reach it?
*102091*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s394_010_son:0-3470]]
Maybe instead of looting a sacred temple, we could just get out of here.
*102092*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf01_s394_020_kra:170-1600]]
If I want your opinion, boy,

I will ask for it.

Climb up, have a look.
*102095*

That’s…
*102175*
[[S:::980-1700]]
good to know.
*102176*
[[S:::1940-2457]]
Really.
*102177*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf01_s420_030_son:80-668]]
So…
*102178*
[[S:::940-2323]]
should we go back to Midgard?
*102179*
[[S:::2540-3619]]
Face the Black Breath?
*102180*
[[S:::4040-5620]]
Or do you think there’s more to see in this realm?
*102181*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl02_s263_010_son_stem:5500-11966]]
Brok! We just came back from another realm and we met your brother. Wait—not in that order.
*102182*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl02_s263_010_brk_stem:13120-16030]]
Did you let that seed-sop put hand to your blade?
*102183*
[[S:::17610-20130]]
You do know he lost his talent, right?
*102184*
[[S:::20630-22700]]
Just up and left him one day—
*102185*
[[S:::23520-25490]]
tried taking me down with him.
*102186*
[[S:::28530-30259]]
Did he botch up our girl?
*102187*
[[S:::39586-45309]]
Hm... well, even a blind pig farts up a truffle now and again.
*102188*
[[S:::45955-48002]]
But do you know what really counts?
*102189*
[[S:::49583-53862]]
Consistency. And I got that comin’ outta ALLA my parts.
*102190*
[[S:::59728-60715]]
It’s better.
*102191*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl02_s263_010_kra_stem:32090-33120]]
Quite the opposite...
*102192*
[[S:::58180-59405]]
What did you do?
*102193*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl02_s080_010_kra_stem:0-1000]]
How does it work?
*102194*
[[S:::18990-19640]]
What now?
*102195*
[[S:::114920-115250]]
Yes.
*102196*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl02_s080_010_fre_stem:1550-5830]]
You will need this—a Bifröst—to create travel between realms.
*102197*
[[S:::7220-10370]]
It can capture, hold, and transfer the Light of Alfheim.
*102198*
[[S:::11250-12610]]
Place the Bifröst there.
*102199*
[[S:::20300-21190]]
Give it a moment.
*102200*
[[S:::21690-24490]]
The temple needs time to wake up from its long slumber.
*102201*
[[S:::25310-26700]]
It is from this room—
*102202*
[[S:::27050-28350]]
and this room alone—
*102203*
[[S:::28720-31310]]
that you will be able to cross between realms.
*102204*
[[S:::33960-37530]]
What you see before you represents the temple in which we stand,
*102205*
[[S:::38060-41780]]
as well as the realm towers that encircle the Lake of Nine outside.
*102206*
[[S:::42750-47811]]
All the realms exist in the same physical space, reflections of each other.
*102207*
[[S:::48110-53850]]
These doors, the towers outside, and the nine realms are all intertwined
*102208*
[[S:::53850-57360]]
and co-existing on the branches of the World Tree—
*102209*
[[S:::57540-60790]]
separated only by the Bifröst light of Alfheim.
*102210*
[[S:::61590-64480]]
This place can focus and control that light.
*102211*
[[S:::66890-73550]]
Only an artistic representation of it. No, the Yggdrasill is much, much more than this.
*102212*
[[S:::73550-79050]]
The Tree of Life is bound to the fate of the world, just as we are bound to it.
*102213*
[[S:::80070-86520]]
The tree nourishes our soils. The dew from its leaves feeds our valleys and rivers.
*102214*
[[S:::87110-92020]]
The tree’s very existence supports all of creation along its boughs—
*102215*
[[S:::92020-96050]]
its life energy interwoven into the tapestry of life…
*102216*
[[S:::96050-100980]]
birth, growth, death, and rebirth…
*102217*
[[S:::100980-105660]]
every strand, transcending time, transcending space.
*102218*
[[S:::105660-107750]]
Everything comes back to the tree.
*102219*
[[S:::108830-114920]]
So… that’s how it works. But I’m guessing you were looking for a more practical answer.
*102220*
[[S:::116490-117540]]
Very well…
*102221*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl02_s080_010_son_stem:65060-66180]]
And is this the World Tree?
*102222*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s002_010_fre:130-820]]
Watch your step.
*102223*
[[S:::1310-2000]]
Just along here.
*102224*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s002_020_son:40-4030]]
You sure? We came through here before and there’s no way back across.
*102225*
[[S:::4530-5030]]
See?
*102226*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s002_030_fre:130-1000]]
Is that so?
*102227*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s002_040_fre:120-1250]]
Let me show you something.
*102228*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s002_050_fre:120-750]]
Are you watching?
*102229*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s002_051_fre:176-1034]]
Ljósta!
*102230*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s002_060_son:51-1589]]
What? It’s solid!
*102231*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s002_070_fre:130-1400]]
Elven architecture.
*102232*
[[S:::1790-4100]]
My bowstring was soaked in the Light of Alfheim.
*102233*
[[S:::4610-7180]]
It can now reawaken the magic of the Elves.
*102234*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s002_080_son:80-2281]]
Wait… it won’t just disappear, will it?
*102235*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s002_090_fre:120-1860]]
Not as long as the light shines free.
*102236*
[[S:::2940-3250]]
This way.
*102237*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s002_100_son:940-1530]]
I want one.
*102238*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_cl02_s004_006_fre:165-675]]
Rót!
*102239*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_cl02_s004_006_fre_a:130-350]]
Rót!
*102240*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_cl02_s004_006_fre_b:183-803]]
Rót!
*102241*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_cl02_s004_006_fre_c:130-550]]
Rót!
*102242*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s004_010_son:0-830]]
Those roots—
*102243*
[[S:::1360-2650]]
what kind of magic is that?
*102244*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s004_020_fre:5-779]]
It’s Vanir.
*102245*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s004_030_son:0-750]]
From Vanaheim?
*102246*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s004_040_fre:0-630]]
You know of it?
*102247*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s004_050_son:0-690]]
Just stories.
*102248*
[[S:::1190-3150]]
Mother didn’t say much about the Vanir gods,
*102249*
[[S:::3630-5560]]
just that they’re always at war with the Aesir.
*102250*
[[S:::6020-8500]]
Guess compared to Odin & Thor, they’re the good guys.
*102251*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl02_s004_060_kra:60-1970]]
There are no “good” gods, boy.
*102252*
[[S:::2320-3250]]
Thought I taught you that.
*102253*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s004_070_fre:130-2000]]
When you’re ready—through these doors.
*102254*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s005_010_fre:120-1240]]
The tongue of Niflheim.
*102255*
[[S:::1670-3980]]
A foul place of ice and mists…
*102256*
[[S:::4750-5700]]
and Dwarven mischief.
*102257*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s005_020_fre:130-1680]]
Those runes are of Muspelheim,
*102258*
[[S:::2050-3040]]
the fire realm.
*102259*
[[S:::3690-5090]]
No place for children,
*102260*
[[S:::5810-6750]]
even brave ones.
*102261*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s005_030_son:20-1200]]
I still can’t read these.
*102262*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s005_040_son:41-1356]]
These are the ones I can’t read.
*102263*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s005_050_son:30-700]]
I told you,
*102264*
[[S:::1240-2450]]
we should come back with a cipher.
*102265*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s010_010_son:50-3160]]
The boat? But the witch is showing us to the temple, remember?
*102266*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s020_010_fre:130-1090]]
Týr’s Temple.
*102267*
[[S:::1830-3648]]
Built with help from the Giants,
*102268*
[[S:::3875-8040]]
Great Týr used it to travel the nine realms and keep the peace between them.
*102269*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s020_020_son:190-3550]]
Doesn’t seem very peaceful. Everywhere we go, we’re attacked.
*102270*
[[S:::4030-5250]]
Especially by dead things.
*102271*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s020_030_fre:130-2470]]
The risen dead grow ever more numerous.
*102272*
[[S:::3560-6440]]
Once, the roads and trails would have been full of people.
*102273*
[[S:::7190-9060]]
Now, all have hid or fled,
*102274*
[[S:::9450-10630]]
save for the reavers
*102275*
[[S:::11010-13250]]
savage enough to survive in such a world.
*102276*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s030_010_fre:0-1750]]
Make a right at the bottom of these stairs.
*102277*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s030_020_fre:110-2940]]
Please, take those stairs down and turn right.
*102278*
[[S:::3330-4250]]
I’ll be waiting up here.
*102279*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s030_030_son:20-290]]
Hey,
*102280*
[[S:::660-2000]]
another one of those light crystals.
*102281*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s030_040_fre:130-2250]]
Wait there while I reawaken the light.
*102282*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s030_041_fre:165-1055]]
Ljósta!
*102283*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s030_050_son:49-651]]
That did it.
*102284*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_005_son:0-1326]]
What are we doing exactly?
*102285*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_006_fre:120-1460]]
Mending the disrepair.
*102286*
[[S:::2020-3750]]
Start by lifting that axle.
*102287*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_010_fre:390-2250]]
Good! Now push it back into place.
*102288*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_015_fre:200-2500]]
Now realign the wheel onto the track.
*102289*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_016_fre:162-3212]]
Perfect! Now push the bridge along the track.
*102290*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_020_son:24-545]]
Whuh—?
*102291*
[[S:::1255-2920]]
The whole entire bridge is turning!
*102292*
[[S:::3550-5244]]
How is the whole entire bridge turning?
*102293*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_030_son:150-648]]
Boy,
*102294*
[[S:::1290-2438]]
you’re really strong.
*102295*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_033_fre:110-3750]]
Just keep pushing until the bridge reaches its first position.
*102296*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_037_fre:120-1000]]
Tired yet?
*102297*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_040_kra:53-584]]
NO.
*102298*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_043_son:83-1459]]
He’s always been really strong!
*102299*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_047_fre:130-1000]]
I can see that!
*102300*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_050_son:50-1180]]
You are tired though, right?
*102301*
[[S:::1690-2500]]
You’re just saying that?
*102302*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_053_kra:54-970]]
I am fine.
*102303*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_057_son:74-647]]
Wow.
*102304*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_058_son:70-940]]
So about the dead…
*102305*
[[S:::1760-3460]]
we heard someone call them “Hel-Walkers”.
*102306*
[[S:::4300-5000]]
But what are they?
*102307*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_059_fre:140-4500]]
They are poor, restless souls, denied their judgement and their peace.
*102308*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_061_son:40-670]]
By what?
*102309*
[[S:::1100-2567]]
Could Vanir magic raise the dead?
*102310*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_062_fre:120-1685]]
It could, once,
*102311*
[[S:::2210-3690]]
but this is no spell.
*102312*
[[S:::4510-8250]]
This plague of dead is but a symptom of a world out of balance.
*102313*
[[S:::8970-12540]]
Something, or someone, has meddled with powerful forces.
*102314*
[[S:::13400-15019]]
That is all I know for sure.
*102315*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_060_fre:110-950]]
Keep going!
*102316*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_063_fre:90-1299]]
Almost there!
*102317*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_067_fre:230-1887]]
Just a little more to go!
*102318*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_070_fre:91-3482]]
That’s perfect! Come back up! We’re ready now!
*102319*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_080_fre:40-1190]]
You’re not done yet!
*102320*
[[S:::1590-6702]]
You have to push the bridge all the way to the end for the mechanism to reset.
*102321*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_090_son:0-3585]]
I think she said you have to push the bridge all the way to the end for the something to get reset.
*102322*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_100_son:65-1119]]
That was impressive.
*102323*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_110_son:21-1177]]
You didn’t hurt your back, did you?
*102324*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl02_s040_120_kra:0-1739]]
I did not hurt my back.
*102325*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s050_010_fre:140-1250]]
Through these doors.
*102326*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s050_020_son:0-380]]
Wait.
*102327*
[[S:::890-3250]]
So did the Giants or the Elves build Týr’s temple?
*102328*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s050_030_fre:0-5390]]
All the races helped with its construction. It was the last great act of cooperation between the realms
*102329*
[[S:::5390-7250]]
before peace disappeared for good.
*102330*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s050_040_son:0-630]]
We’re leaving?
*102331*
[[S:::1110-2390]]
But the witch is showing us something.
*102332*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl02_s050_050_kra:0-750]]
She will wait.
*102333*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s050_060_son:0-1000]]
Wow, okay.
*102334*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s050_070_fre:110-1250]]
I was wondering if you’d ever come back.
*102335*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s060_005_fre:166-935]]
Ljósta!
*102336*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s060_005_fre_a:240-750]]
Ljósta!
*102337*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s060_005_fre_b:172-953]]
Ljósta!
*102338*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s060_010_son:57-1442]]
Your bowstring stopped glowing.
*102339*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s060_020_fre:0-1590]]
Its power is now depleted.
*102340*
[[S:::2220-5710]]
Only a few nocks of magic remained in the bowstring, and we used them.
*102341*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s060_030_fre:0-750]]
Your bow please.
*102342*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s060_040_fre:0-4000]]
Once you claim the Light of Alfheim, infuse the bowstring with its power. Don’t forget!
*102343*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s060_050_son:41-1596]]
You talk like you’re not coming with us.
*102344*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s060_060_fre:43-3795]]
I’ll try, but measures were taken to keep me trapped in Midgard.
*102345*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl02_s060_070_kra:0-250]]
Why?
*102346*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s060_080_fre:0-1520]]
The gods don’t care for me much.
*102347*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s070_010_son:0-700]]
Is this it?
*102348*
[[S:::1110-2024]]
It’s so dark.
*102349*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s070_015_fre:0-1450]]
This temple has been asleep,
*102350*
[[S:::1840-4500]]
underwater, for almost a hundred and fifty winters.
*102351*
[[S:::4500-7750]]
It needs only the light of the Bifröst to reawaken.
*102352*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s070_020_son:44-1647]]
Those roots don’t look like your magic.
*102353*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s070_025_fre:130-840]]
They aren’t.
*102354*
[[S:::1320-6250]]
These roots are part of the great World Tree, and make travel between the realms possible.
*102355*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s070_030_fre:100-1250]]
Approach the table.
*102356*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl02_s070_040_kra:30-750]]
We will return.
*102357*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s070_050_fre:120-950]]
I’ll be waiting.
*102358*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s070_060_fre:110-750]]
Over here.
*102359*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s070_070_fre:0-3900]]
I can teach you how to travel between realms, but not unless you’re over here.
*102360*
[[S:::4420-4750]]
Come.
*102361*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_046_fre:100-4190]]
The bridge you pushed outside is currently positioned to lead to the realm of Vanaheim.
*102362*
[[S:::4590-8750]]
Instead, turn the wheel to our actual destination—Alfheim.
*102363*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_050_fre:0-2500]]
You must select the destination realm… Alfheim.
*102364*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_060_fre:0-1740]]
Turn the wheel to Alfheim please.
*102365*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_070_fre:28-1055]]
Why isn’t he listening to me?
*102366*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_080_son:0-1250]]
He gets like this sometimes.
*102367*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_090_son:0-310]]
Wait,
*102368*
[[S:::700-2360]]
is this moving the big bridge outside?
*102369*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_100_fre:0-6303]]
Yes. The wheel turns the bridge, and the bridge aligns to the different realm towers on the lake outside.
*102370*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_110_son:110-2000]]
Wait… there’s no tower on this one.
*102371*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_120_fre:0-2710]]
And that’s why realm travel to Jötunheim is impossible.
*102372*
[[S:::3320-7220]]
Without a tower for the bridge to lock into, the sequence can’t begin.
*102373*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_130_fre:60-3890]]
Every realm has a travel rune that unlocks the bridge to that realm.
*102374*
[[S:::4370-6260]]
I’m giving you the one for Alfheim.
*102375*
[[S:::6630-8500]]
Now you can lock in your destination.
*102376*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_140_fre:40-4000]]
We’re ready. Remember to take the Bifröst—you don’t want to lose that.
*102377*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s080_150_fre:80-5000]]
Now the realm travel bridge will align, and the realm between realms will open.
*102378*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_020_fre:130-1310]]
See that giant crystal?
*102379*
[[S:::1910-7775]]
Each realm has a corresponding one that focuses and amplifies the power of the Bifröst,
*102380*
[[S:::7775-9020]]
opening the bridge to that realm.
*102381*
[[S:::9460-12750]]
That’s why realm travel is only possible from this room.
*102382*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_030_son:30-2195]]
What about that one realm tower missing from the lake?
*102383*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_040_fre:130-4720]]
The Jötunheim tower disappeared from all realms over a hundred winters ago,
*102384*
[[S:::4720-6640]]
when the Giants vanished from Midgard.
*102385*
[[S:::7240-10000]]
Where the tower went and how they moved it remain a mystery.
*102386*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_050_son:50-1816]]
It didn’t work. We’re still here.
*102387*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_060_fre:130-750]]
Follow me.
*102388*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_070_kra:60-1250]]
The Bifröst is dark.
*102389*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_080_fre:0-1530]]
This trip was its last use.
*102390*
[[S:::2180-4995]]
There’s no going back until it’s replenished with the Light of Alfheim.
*102391*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_090_kra:0-1000]]
So we are trapped.
*102392*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_100_fre:110-3500]]
Someone of your ability should have little trouble getting back to Midgard.
*102393*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_100_fre_a:120-3250]]
Someone of your ability should have little trouble getting back to Midgard.
*102394*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_110_son:31-2099]]
And we’ll be able to make that Black Breath go away?
*102395*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_120_fre:130-2000]]
With the captured Light of Alfheim, yes.
*102396*
[[S:HERMIT WITCH:vo_lvl_cl02_s090_120_fre_a:130-2250]]
With the captured Light of Alfheim, yes.
*102397*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s010_010_son:0-450]]
What now?
*102398*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl03_s010_020_kra:0-890]]
We have the Light.
*102399*
[[S:::1330-2000]]
To Midgard.
*102400*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s010_030_son:0-2210]]
Oooooor… we could explore some more.
*102401*
[[S:::2690-3040]]
I mean,
*102402*
[[S:::3430-5290]]
I think Mom would have wanted me to see other realms,
*102403*
[[S:::5720-6000]]
right?
*102404*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl03_s010_040_kra:28-583]]
Mm.
*102405*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s010_050_son:53-565]]
Yes!
*102406*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl03_s030_010_kra:30-2500]]
Do you remember the way back to the Black Breath?
*102407*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s030_020_son:150-970]]
Of course.
*102408*
[[S:::1570-3740]]
We need to walk across the bridge to the Vanaheim tower.
*102409*
[[S:::4650-5700]]
Are we going to the Black Breath?
*102410*
[[S:::6320-7000]]
Or exploring?
*102411*
[[S:::7900-8400]]
Your choice.
*102412*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s040_010_son:36-3757]]
Look. We rowed passed that statue of Thor earlier—when we left the Witch’s cave.
*102413*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl03_s040_020_kra:30-1250]]
And what direction is that?
*102414*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s040_030_son:40-3500]]
It’s mid-morning, the sun is over there, soooo…
*102415*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s040_040_son:69-2559]]
That’s south… south-west?
*102416*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl03_s040_050_kra:30-350]]
Good.
*102417*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s050a_010_son:50-1179]]
I can read these now!
*102418*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s050a_020_son:50-1270]]
It says in Muspelheim,
*102419*
[[S:::1790-2720]]
the fire realm,
*102420*
[[S:::3180-4590]]
is the Gauntlet of Surtr.
*102421*
[[S:::5770-6090]]
Like…
*102422*
[[S:::6510-7250]]
a magic glove?
*102423*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl03_s050a_030_kra:50-1500]]
Or a series of dangers.
*102424*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s050a_040_son:40-1000]]
We should go see sometime.
*102425*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl03_s050a_050_mmr:150-2000]]
Our young god knows no fear!
*102426*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl03_s050a_050_mmr_a:130-2000]]
Our young god knows no fear!
*102427*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s050b_010_son:30-1168]]
I can read these now!
*102428*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s050b_020_son:0-2590]]
It says the Gauntlet of Surtr is in Muspelheim.
*102429*
[[S:::3760-5140]]
Is that what those challenges are called?
*102430*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl03_s050b_030_kra:165-750]]
It may be.
*102431*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl03_s050b_040_mmr:50-4000]]
Ah, that makes sense… who else would be training in a place like Muspelheim?
*102432*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl03_s050b_050_mmr:80-2000]]
Have you been going to the fire realm?
*102433*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s050b_060_son:80-2291]]
Yeah. We didn’t get too far.
*102434*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl03_s050b_070_mmr:0-2519]]
Well, you’re getting stronger all the time.
*102435*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s050b_080_son:52-758]]
That’s true…
*102436*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s055_010_son:80-2202]]
Did you see something out there? That tower…
*102437*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl03_s055_020_kra:120-1000]]
I see no tower.
*102438*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s055_030_son:60-1140]]
Maybe I’m seeing things…
*102439*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s060_010_son:0-570]]
Oh, look…
*102440*
[[S:::1020-3350]]
the witch’s magic is still covering those scorn poles.
*102441*
[[S:::4410-5310]]
Saves us some time…
*102442*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s070_010_son:0-390]]
Oh,
*102443*
[[S:::1270-2510]]
but her light bridge is gone.
*102444*
[[S:::3880-6900]]
I’d make one myself, but the crystal’s gone.
*102445*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl03_s015_010_son:35-5531]]
It’s crazy to think that all the realms exist in the same space, one on top of the other.
*102446*
[[S:::5531-7729]]
It’s like this room lets us travel without moving!
*102447*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s020_010_son:70-1950]]
Sindri’s Skyway cart is still down there…
*102448*
[[S:::2420-3569]]
if you don’t feel like climbing.
*102449*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s030_010_son:0-2500]]
No roots. Guess the witch never came this way.
*102450*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s040_010_son:70-2750]]
Even with the coffin empty, this place is still creepy.
*102451*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s050_010_son:140-1210]]
Father? Do you…
*102452*
[[S:::1670-2750]]
do you think I could carry her now?
*102453*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl02_s050_020_kra:38-500]]
No.
*102454*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s050_030_son:0-323]]
But I—
*102455*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl02_s050_040_kra:50-1019]]
I said no.
*102456*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s050_050_son:87-582]]
Okay.
*102457*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s060_010_son:120-2110]]
So who do you think carved the face in the mountain?
*102458*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl02_s060_020_kra:40-1250]]
You would know better than I.
*102459*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s060_030_son:30-400]]
Thanks.
*102460*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl02_s060_040_kra:100-1000]]
Now watch your step.
*102461*
[[S:::1610-3250]]
Carelessness will only delay us.
*102462*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s060_050_son:52-695]]
Right.
*102463*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s070_010_son:70-1320]]
Well there’s the Black Breath again.
*102464*
[[S:::1690-2250]]
What do we do now?
*102465*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl02_s070_020_kra:50-1500]]
We see if the witch was right.
*102466*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s070_030_son:142-1991]]
It’s working! She was right!
*102467*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl02_s070_040_kra:70-410]]
Come.
*102468*
[[S:::840-1750]]
Let us finish this.
*102469*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s080_010_son:60-790]]
The path ahead—
*102470*
[[S:::1360-1920]]
it’s blocked.
*102471*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl02_s080_020_kra:0-750]]
Then we climb.
*102472*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s090_010_son:0-4250]]
You know… mother said the Giants used to visit the Midgard mountains before they disappeared. 
*102473*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl02_s090_020_kra:0-500]]
Disappeared?
*102474*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s090_030_son:0-3000]]
Yeah. I guess they just up and left one day. No one knows why. 
*102475*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl02_s090_040_kra:0-1500]]
Perhaps they returned to their home.
*102476*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s090_050_son:80-700]]
To Jötunheim?
*102477*
[[S:::1070-1560]]
Maybe.
*102478*
[[S:::2000-5000]]
I wonder if the face in the mountain was a tribute to some important Giant?
*102479*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s100_010_son:0-1530]]
The mouth… we made it.
*102480*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl02_s100_020_kra:80-1000]]
More Black Breath.
*102481*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s110_010_son:0-660]]
Where are we going?
*102482*
[[S:::1360-2500]]
The entrance was back there.
*102483*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl02_s110_020_kra:70-1000]]
Are you in a hurry?
*102484*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s110_030_son:0-520]]
No!
*102485*
[[S:::1560-2910]]
But you normally are.
*102486*
[[S:::4010-5250]]
I’m happy to keep exploring.
*102487*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl02_s120_010_son:0-1030]]
You want to leave already?
*102488*
[[S:::1880-2750]]
We just got here.
*102489*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv04_s330_010_son_stem:2100-3814]]
Father—she is here!
*102490*
[[S:::5540-7987]]
It is so good to see you again!
*102491*
[[S:::8130-9864]]
I knew you weren’t dead.
*102492*
[[S:::12036-14565]]
Oh…Can you bring a head back to life?
*102493*
[[S:::26337-27191]]
They were a gift…
*102494*
[[S:::42470-46234]]
I understand! If I see them, I’ll destroy them!
*102495*
[[S:::82730-83681]]
Please?
*102496*
[[S:::138991-140532]]
It worked!
*102497*
[[S:::170083-172023]]
Freya? The goddess Freya?
*102498*
[[S:::197634-197845]]
But—
*102499*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv04_s330_010_fre_stem:10427-11990]]
Hello…!
*102500*
[[S:::16541-18183]]
I’m… not sure I understand what…
*102501*
[[S:::18511-21737]]
Wait… Where did you get those?
*102502*
[[S:::21737-25831]]
The arrows… Give them to me. NOW.
*102503*
[[S:::30624-37710]]
These arrows are dangerous… they’re wicked. You find any more, you destroy them. Understand?
*102504*
[[S:::39188-42266]]
DO YOU UNDERSTAND? SAY IT!
*102505*
[[S:::48240-50617]]
It’s all I ask. Forgive me.
*102506*
[[S:::51257-55629]]
Please—take my arrows in their place. I have no need for them anymore.
*102507*
[[S:::61324-65195]]
Now… what’s this about a head?
*102508*
[[S:::69319-73666]]
Do you have any idea who this is? Did you kill him?
*102509*
[[S:::80009-81965]]
Me? Are you sure you heard him right?
*102510*
[[S:::87162-88581]]
Take him to the table.
*102511*
[[S:::89047-97732]]
Heimili. It’s been a long time since I’ve practised the Old magic. Hold him there—let’s have a look.
*102512*
[[S:::98226-106484]]
Well, thankfully, his head hasn’t decayed much and his brain is still intact. Nice, clean cut.
*102513*
[[S:::108192-113184]]
Cutting off his head of all people… I sure hope you know what you’re doing.
*102514*
[[S:::114497-118870]]
Now hold his head under the water and don’t let go. I mean it.
*102515*
[[S:::131283-132422]]
That’s enough
*102516*
[[S:::141185-142077]]
Let me see him.
*102517*
[[S:::145882-148301]]
Mimir… you there?
*102518*
[[S:::149819-151140]]
Good.
*102519*
[[S:::156968-161578]]
What I did, I did for them. As far as I’m concerned, death suits you better.
*102520*
[[S:::175467-179066]]
When word gets out that Mimir is free, the wrath of Odin won’t be far behind.
*102521*
[[S:::181841-185183]]
Leader of the Vanir once, yes… but no longer.
*102522*
[[S:::189313-193443]]
Are you really going to lecture me about that?
*102523*
[[S:::200770-202201]]
You’re welcome!
*102524*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv04_s330_010_kra_stem:27539-28716]]
Do as she says, boy.
*102525*
[[S:::74320-75340]]
At his request.
*102526*
[[S:::76090-78075]]
He claimed you could revive him.
*102527*
[[S:::179280-180240]]
You are a god…..
*102528*
[[S:::185809-187550]]
You did not think it important to tell me?
*102529*
[[S:::194816-197411]]
We are leaving, boy. Now.
*102530*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv04_s330_010_mmr_stem:148220-148670]]
Yes…
*102531*
[[S:::151770-152310]]
Oh…
*102532*
[[S:::153150-154870]]
Hello, Freya. Been a long time!
*102533*
[[S:::155530-156490]]
You look well.
*102534*
[[S:::162071-164705]]
I’d bow if I could, your majesty. Forgive me—
*102535*
[[S:::165180-169663]]
had I known the “witch in the woods” was Freya herself, I never would have suggested this.
*102536*
[[S:::172580-172850]]
You didn’t know either?
*102537*
[[S:::174680-175154]]
Sorry.
*102538*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s010_010_son:100-1490]]
I know she’s really powerful,
*102539*
[[S:::1960-4220]]
but you really think the witch can bring a head back to life?
*102540*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s010_020_kra:0-1780]]
She seems competent in her craft.
*102541*
[[S:::2480-3420]]
And we have nothing to lose.
*102542*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s010_030_son:30-3231]]
If she can’t bring it back to life, can we keep the head?
*102543*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s010_040_kra:0-500]]
No.
*102544*
[[S:::1540-2930]]
But you may feed it to the fish.
*102545*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s010_050_son:90-569]]
Okay!
*102546*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s030_010_son:100-1000]]
And now the door’s gone.
*102547*
[[S:::2250-3820]]
The Witch’s turtle must be standing up.
*102548*
[[S:::5040-6250]]
So how do we get back up there?
*102549*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s040_010_son:0-3250]]
She must have some way of getting back to the surface when the turtle’s standing.
*102550*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s040_020_kra:17-707]]
Keep looking.
*102551*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s040_030_son:70-1250]]
Maybe there’s a way we couldn’t get through before, but now we can.
*102552*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s040_040_son:0-370]]
Wait—
*102553*
[[S:::770-2500]]
I bet my new arrows could shatter something?
*102554*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s040_050_son:60-1050]]
I bet this’ll lead out…
*102555*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s050_010_son:90-3849]]
“Turn back, Aesir.” Guess the gods aren’t welcome here.
*102556*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s060_010_son:66-2806]]
(gasps) There he is! I hope he remembers us.
*102557*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s070_010_son:64-2589]]
“Of old was the age / When Ymir lived”.
*102558*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s090_010_son:150-1250]]
“Death to the Raven God,
*102559*
[[S:::1950-2750]]
Lord of the Hanged”.
*102560*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s090_020_mmr:30-1340]]
That’s talking about Odin.
*102561*
[[S:::1690-4500]]
He’s known by many names, not all of them nice.
*102562*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s100_010_son:0-2640]]
“Seiðr níðings upon all who trespass”.
*102563*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s100_020_mmr:50-4250]]
Níðings are ancient curses. Old magic. Best to avoid.
*102564*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_010_son:80-1250]]
Another one of those sand bowls.
*102565*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_020_son:0-800]]
Want me to read this one?
*102566*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_030_kra:0-890]]
What does it say?
*102567*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_040_son:80-1580]]
“Falcon, Hawk, and Turtle-Dove /
*102568*
[[S:::2120-3540]]
Swim aloft in oceans above.”
*102569*
[[S:::5230-5690]]
Huh?
*102570*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_050_kra:0-1500]]
Those runes on the rock.
*102571*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_051_son:9-2714]]
They don’t spell anything. It’s gibberish.
*102572*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_060_son:122-2076]]
I’m sure we’ll find the answer around here somewhere…
*102573*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_070_kra:90-500]]
Here, boy.
*102574*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_080_son:4-5885]]
I know those runes. That’s “vindr”. Wind! Must be for that sand bowl down there.
*102575*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_081_kra:0-500]]
Here, boy.
*102576*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_082_son:50-2600]]
Oh! The rest of the runes were hidden over the hill.
*102577*
[[S:::3260-4750]]
That’s “vindr”. Wind!
*102578*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_090_kra:0-1000]]
Back to the sand bowl.
*102579*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_091_kra:0-750]]
What does it say?
*102580*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_092_son:0-2290]]
“Falcon, Hawk, and Turtle-Dove /
*102581*
[[S:::2920-4856]]
Swim aloft in oceans above.”
*102582*
[[S:::5780-6369]]
Ah—
*102583*
[[S:::6951-7490]]
“Wind”…
*102584*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_093_son:24-762]]
Vindr…
*102585*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_100_kra:31-653]]
Draw it.
*102586*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_110_son:69-596]]
Sir.
*102587*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_120_son:54-775]]
Vindr…
*102588*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s110_130_son:90-823]]
Look what it did!
*102589*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s120_010_son:80-990]]
How’s it going, Chaurli?
*102590*
[[S:::1610-2410]]
Is your witch friend here?
*102591*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s120_020_kra:50-1500]]
What is that name?
*102592*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s120_030_son:84-4789]]
That’s what he told me it was—or what it sounded like in my head anyway. Chaurli!
*102593*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_010_son:49-1086]]
Why did you do that?
*102594*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_020_kra:0-1090]]
We cannot trust her.
*102595*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_030_son:47-1046]]
Because she’s a god?
*102596*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_040_kra:32-1713]]
Have I taught you nothing, boy?
*102597*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_050_son:95-1369]]
But she’s helped us a lot.
*102598*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_060_kra:0-750]]
She lied.
*102599*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_070_mmr:30-1730]]
Some people value their privacy.
*102600*
[[S:::2140-3460]]
Best not to judge, brother.
*102601*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_080_kra:0-1930]]
When I require your counsel, head,
*102602*
[[S:::2340-2940]]
I will ask.
*102603*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_090_mmr:0-840]]
Fair enough.
*102604*
[[S:::1430-5750]]
Get me to Týr’s temple, in the Lake of the Nine, and I’ll get you to Jötunheim as promised.
*102605*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_100_son:0-760]]
We know the temple.
*102606*
[[S:::1150-1750]]
What’s there?
*102607*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_110_mmr:50-4500]]
Only the last living Giant in Midgard. Who better to tell us the way?
*102608*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_120_son:80-1047]]
The world serpent?
*102609*
[[S:::1652-1999]]
Wait—
*102610*
[[S:::2204-3189]]
do you know how to talk to him?
*102611*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_130_mmr:30-740]]
Indeed.
*102612*
[[S:::1170-4840]]
He speaks an obscure tongue, more ancient even than these mountains.
*102613*
[[S:::5310-9000]]
None are left in Midgard who speak it. Except, of course, for me.
*102614*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_140_son:18-733]]
You do?
*102615*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s130_150_mmr:30-5555]]
It’s true. You wouldn’t know it to look at him, but Jörmungandr is a sparkling conversationalist.
*102616*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s150_010_son:0-1062]]
She won’t answer the door.
*102617*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s150_020_mmr:0-2340]]
Did not leave her in the best of moods, did you?
*102618*
[[S:::2830-5000]]
Frankly, I’m surprised you’d want to come back here…
*102619*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv04_s150_030_mmr:42-1912]]
Oughtn’t we leave well enough alone, brother?
*102620*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv04_s150_040_son:50-610]]
Yeah.
*102621*
[[S:::1160-3500]]
She already probably won’t ever talk to us again.
*102622*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl10_s010_010_son:0-4650]]
We go where we want, we do what we want, and now we’re gonna go see the Giants!
*102623*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl10_s010_020_mmr:0-2839]]
Aye! Having learned that travel rune to Jötunheim,
*102624*
[[S:::3112-7150]]
we can now head back to the gateway on top of the peak, and put that magic chisel to good use.
*102625*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl10_s010_030_son:50-2330]]
Nobody’s getting in our way this time! Come on!
*102626*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl10_s020_010_son:88-3470]]
I’m gonna tell Sindri I’m a god. I’d like to see the look on his face.
*102627*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl10_s020_020_kra:140-650]]
No.
*102628*
[[S:::1010-2960]]
I may have kept your secret too long…
*102629*
[[S:::3460-5750]]
but now you will keep OUR secret.
*102630*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl10_s020_030_son:59-608]]
Huh.
*102631*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl10_s030_010_son:190-1340]]
Why should we hide what we are?
*102632*
[[S:::1810-2940]]
Secrets are Odin’s way.
*102633*
[[S:::3470-4470]]
Shouldn’t we be open,
*102634*
[[S:::5000-5500]]
like Týr?
*102635*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl10_s030_020_kra:110-2700]]
Týr kept secrets too. For good reasons.
*102636*
[[S:::3190-4240]]
To protect people.
*102637*
[[S:::4810-6250]]
It is wiser to be discreet.
*102638*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl10_s030_030_son:127-3187]]
That doesn’t mean you should lie to your friends, or your family…
*102639*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl10_s030_040_mmr:137-3830]]
I’m sure Sindri would understand and do the same, lad. Don’t fret.
*102640*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl10_s025_010_son:40-590]]
Oh yeah,
*102641*
[[S:::1030-2000]]
I can translate this now…
*102642*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl10_s025_020_son:20-790]]

*102644*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl10_s025_030_mmr:100-3250]]
Aye, and a bloody infinite number of traps…
*102645*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl10_s025_030_mmr_a:110-740]]
Aye,

[[S:::1240-3000]]
and a bloody infinite number of traps…
*102647*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl10_s025_040_son:50-2000]]
Oh yeah, I can translate this now…
*102648*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl10_s025_050_son:40-840]]

*102650*
[[S:::3980-6000]]
Hey, nobody mentioned fortune—
*102651*
[[S:::6750-7750]]
we should go there sometime!
*102652*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl04_s010_010_kra:150-2500]]
Do you remember the way back to the witch from here?
*102653*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl04_s010_020_son:50-600]]
That way!
*102654*
[[S:::970-2330]]
Behind the big statue of Thor.
*102655*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl04_s020_010_son:0-2210]]
Oh. Guess we’re not going back to the witch just yet.
*102656*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl04_s030_010_kra:0-1750]]
Boy, what is the path back to the witch?
*102657*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl04_s030_020_son:0-1150]]
First we need to find a boat.
*102658*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl04_s040_010_son:0-510]]
Weird.
*102659*
[[S:::1140-3250]]
I just saw a glint of light coming off the hammer…
*102660*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl04_s040_020_kra:9-1575]]
That is not important now.
*102661*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl04_s040_030_son:0-460]]
I know.
*102662*
[[S:::1010-1690]]

Oh fer… you already soiled my solitude, so ya may as well join me.

[[S:::25972-28728]]

Congratulations.

[[S:::34841-42044]]
And I’m sure you let him go and roger my axe good and plenty again. Let’s see the damage…
*102673*
[[S:::48602-54965]]
Little canker-throat wouldn’t know proper weight and balance if it were dangling off his chut.
*102674*
[[S:::58935-60734]]
He eating well enough?

Leave him, boy.

We are not hungry.

Do not waste our food, boy.

Spoil-sport.

*102691*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s010_020_mmr:80-3400]]
There’s a horn on a platform at the middle point of the bridge. Take me to it.
*102692*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s010_030_son:26-1497]]
Finally! That Horn!
*102693*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s020_010_mmr:0-1750]]
Good. Now put my lips to the horn.
*102694*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s030_010_mmr:0-1250]]
Listen closely now…
*102695*
[[S:::2030-4849]]
we need two things to get us into the land of the Giants.
*102696*
[[S:::5139-9156]]
First, we need to learn the travel rune that opens realm travel to Jötunheim.
*102697*
[[S:::9476-12843]]
Second, we need to carve that rune into the special gateway.
*102698*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s030_040_son:12-1700]]
That one on the peak where we first met you?
*102699*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s030_050_mmr:0-530]]
Correct.
*102700*
[[S:::1140-6150]]
Except the Giants, in their infinite wisdom, saw to it that no ordinary chisel would do the job.
*102701*
[[S:::6480-9080]]
Only the tip of a magical chisel opens that gate.
*102702*
[[S:::9540-10850]]
Luckily, I know where it is
*102703*
[[S:::11370-12250]]
and it’s not far.
*102704*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s030_011_son:100-1660]]
He looked kinda mad for a moment there.
*102705*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s030_012_mmr:110-681]]
Ah. That.
*102706*
[[S:::982-2960]]
He thought I said you were friends of Odin.
*102707*
[[S:::3300-4057]]
You’ll forgive me—
*102708*
[[S:::4254-6473]]
I’ve never spoken the Ancient Tongue sober.
*102709*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s030_012_mmr_a:110-707]]
Ah. That.
*102710*
[[S:::970-2966]]
He thought I said you were friends of Odin.
*102711*
[[S:::3266-3972]]
You’ll forgive me—
*102712*
[[S:::4398-6576]]
I’ve never spoken the Ancient Tongue sober.
*102713*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s030_013_son:160-940]]
Wait, look!
*102714*
[[S:::1790-3230]]
The water’s dropped even further!
*102715*
[[S:::3600-5655]]
You can see more of the realm towers and statues.
*102716*
[[S:::6203-8272]]
I even see new places to explore along the shore.
*102717*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s030_020_kra:50-1250]]
Where is this chisel?
*102718*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s030_030_mmr:70-2026]]
Find me a boat and we’ll go from there.
*102719*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s040_010_son:150-1365]]
So when we get to the boat,
*102720*
[[S:::1970-3912]]
we can either look for that special chisel now,
*102721*
[[S:::4387-5707]]
or go exploring for a little while.
*102722*
[[S:::6314-7597]]
I’m happy with whatever you wanna do…
*102723*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s050_010_son:0-1250]]
What’s hiding behind there?
*102724*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s050_020_mmr:100-5340]]
No earthly key nor physical force can get past the magic of that lock. Don’t even look at it.
*102725*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_010_son:40-1500]]
Never seen a lock like that before.
*102726*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_020_mmr:170-2280]]
Reminds me of something I’d seen Týr sketch.
*102727*
[[S:::2690-5680]]
He liked to combine various symbols into runes all his own.
*102728*
[[S:::6200-7500]]
This one, I believe, means—
*102729*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_030_son:50-1380]]
Peace. Unity.
*102730*
[[S:::1730-2330]]
Mercy…
*102731*
[[S:::2890-3790]]
other things too—
*102732*
[[S:::4580-6720]]
I see what he did. But how do we get inside?
*102733*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_040_kra:0-1250]]
We have other concerns.
*102734*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_050_son:100-2085]]
This must be the door that was in Týr’s Triptych!
*102735*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_060_mmr:140-2750]]
I think you’re right. But we still need the key.
*102736*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_070_kra:0-840]]
Back to the dwarf.
*102737*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_080_son:23-1519]]
We’re not gettin’ in there without a key.
*102738*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_090_son:22-714]]
OPEN UP!!
*102739*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_100_son:0-750]]
I really want in.
*102740*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_110_mmr:160-1500]]
Without a key? Wouldn’t bother.
*102741*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_120_mmr:90-2250]]
Eats away at you, doesn’t it? Locked doors.
*102742*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s055_130_kra:0-640]]
Týr’s rune.
*102743*
[[S:::1440-2000]]
This is it.
*102744*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s060_010_kra:50-1250]]
Which way to the chisel?
*102745*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s060_020_mmr:140-3600]]
Keep rowing towards the statues of the oarsmen, then thread past between them.
*102746*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s060_030_kra:0-1000]]
Which way to the chisel?
*102747*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s060_040_mmr:150-5250]]
Boat under the bridge, keep rowing towards the statues of the oarsmen, then thread past between them.
*102748*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s070_010_kra:130-1200]]
This chisel we seek—
*102749*
[[S:::1570-2160]]
what is it?
*102750*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s070_040_mmr:92-4201]]
I’m glad you asked actually. I have just the story for you… (clears throat)
*102751*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s080_010_mmr:310-3022]]
There was a Giant once named Thamur—
*102752*
[[S:::3390-5823]]
a very giant Giant—
*102753*
[[S:::6260-12754]]
who, despite his mountainous size, was without question the greatest stonemason this world had ever seen.
*102754*
[[S:::13450-17878]]
Proud Thamur hoped to one day pass his vast knowledge on to his son,
*102755*
[[S:::18480-21598]]
but young Hrimthur had the heart of a warrior.
*102756*
[[S:::22220-24369]]
Perhaps the father had too much fear in him,
*102757*
[[S:::24740-26009]]
or the son too little…
*102758*
[[S:::26420-30174]]
either way, a quarrel of theirs spiralled out of control,
*102759*
[[S:::30314-34238]]
and the overworked stonemason—bonk!—struck his son.
*102760*
[[S:::34819-36700]]
Hrimthur ran off into the night.
*102761*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s080_020_son:109-1892]]
And?!?  What happened next?
*102762*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s080_011_mmr:0-3710]]
Feeling shame and regret, Thamur chased after his son,
*102763*
[[S:::4200-9591]]
but in his emotional state, soon found himself wandering Midgard, lost and alone.
*102764*
[[S:::10320-11078]]
Sadly,
*102765*
[[S:::11390-16082]]
he caught the eye of the one person he didn’t want to meet alone at night,
*102766*
[[S:::16380-17962]]
so far from home…
*102767*
[[S:::18980-20142]]
Thor.
*102768*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s080_030_mmr:130-1117]]
You’ll see.
*102769*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_001_son:70-1820]]
Okay, I know I saw something.
*102770*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_002_kra:0-1095]]
I saw it too.
*102771*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_003_son:100-2920]]
Freya did say the Jötunheim realm tower was missing from the lake.
*102772*
[[S:::3640-4750]]
But maybe only kinda?
*102773*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_004_mmr:110-1750]]
Very strange indeed…
*102774*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_005_son:147-3535]]
There it was again! It’s there and then it’s not. What does it mean?
*102775*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_010_son:70-1680]]
This is where the tower to Jötunheim should be.
*102776*
[[S:::2640-3220]]
Feels…
*102777*
[[S:::3570-4500]]
strange, somehow.
*102778*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_020_mmr:140-2790]]
No doubt some arcane magicks were involved.
*102779*
[[S:::3180-6500]]
I would be not at all surprised to learn you were sensitive to that.
*102780*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_030_son:42-5283]]
That is where the Jötunheim tower used to be. The Witch said it has been gone for a hundred and fifty winters.
*102781*
[[S:::6686-9424]]
I wonder what kind of magic could make a whole tower disappear.
*102782*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_040_son:45-3580]]
I can’t believe no one has found the Jötunheim tower after so many years.
*102783*
[[S:::3580-5867]]
Where would you hide something that big?
*102784*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_050_son:0-490]]
Was that…
*102785*
[[S:::1240-1810]]
the tower?
*102786*
[[S:::2810-3190]]
Or,
*102787*
[[S:::3570-5340]]
like a ghost of it, or something?
*102788*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_060_son:25-5548]]
There it is again. I swear it looks like the Jötunheim tower… but… only for second.
*102789*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_070_son:51-991]]
There it is again.
*102790*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s065_080_son:36-1049]]
What do you think it is?
*102791*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s075_010_mmr:0-950]]
Ah, good!
*102792*
[[S:::1300-3500]]
The special chisel is ahead, past this gate.
*102793*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_010_son:0-710]]
So, Mimir…
*102794*
[[S:::1910-3250]]
why did Freya spit in your face?
*102795*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_020_kra:30-590]]
No,
*102796*
[[S:::1160-2160]]
speak of Baldur.
*102797*
[[S:::2690-4250]]
He claims nothing harms him.
*102798*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_030_mmr:120-4430]]
Aye, Baldur is blessed with invulnerability to all threats, physical or magical.
*102799*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_040_kra:60-1150]]
The boasting of a god.
*102800*
[[S:::1710-2750]]
Everyone has a weakness.
*102801*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_050_mmr:150-5866]]
Not him, I’m afraid. Baldur is blessed with invulnerability to all threats, physical or magical.
*102802*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_060_son:30-1229]]
You just said that, Mimir.
*102803*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_070_mmr:150-500]]
Did I?
*102804*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_080_kra:20-1240]]
What is the source of this power?
*102805*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_090_mmr:130-2800]]
Well, as I recall… it involved… eh…
*102806*
[[S:::3560-4250]]
a spell…?
*102807*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_100_son:38-738]]
Mimir?
*102808*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_110_mmr:210-2710]]
Parts of m’brain must still be coming back to life.
*102809*
[[S:::3200-5250]]
Just need a moment to finish waking up.
*102810*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s002_120_son:110-1250]]
Hope he’s not broken…
*102811*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s090_010_son:8-3554]]
So to get to the mountain, we have to go through Vanaheim, right?
*102812*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s090_020_mmr:7-4522]]
No, no, NO—that’s not Vanaheim, that’s the Vanaheim Tower,
*102813*
[[S:::4522-6865]]
and both sides of it are still in Midgard.
*102814*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s090_030_son:0-510]]
Oh yeah?
*102815*
[[S:::1260-4493]]
Then why is the bridge always pointing to Vanaheim when we come back to Midgard?
*102816*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s090_040_mmr:0-1180]]
Look, would you rather it didn’t?
*102817*
[[S:::1600-5300]]
Does your life want for lack of time spent bridge-pushing? No?
*102818*
[[S:::5790-6450]]
All right then.
*102819*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s090_050_son:13-4320]]
So let me get this straight—we’re not in Vanaheim right now
*102820*
[[S:::4320-6593]]
even though we’re walking through the Vanaheim Tower?
*102821*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s090_060_mmr:0-2450]]
Correct. We’re still in Midgard.
*102822*
[[S:::2820-8230]]
This tower is just a mirror of an identical tower in Vanaheim that exists in this same spot.
*102823*
[[S:::8740-10660]]
Here in Midgard, it’s just symbolic.
*102824*
[[S:::11080-14250]]
We would need to use the Realm Travel Room to get to Vanaheim.
*102825*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl05_s090_070_son:6-830]]
Confused.
*102826*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl05_s090_080_mmr:60-1500]]
Be grateful it works at all.
*102827*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl06_s340_010_son_stem:27050-28000]]
Why’s he doing that?
*102828*
[[S:::39910-40210]]
But…
*102829*
[[S:::41121-42069]]
doesn’t that hurt?
*102830*
[[S:::142050-142872]]
W—What’s he doing?
*102831*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl06_s340_010_mmr_stem:28730-31770]]
Odin had that statue made in honour of Thor.
*102832*
[[S:::32520-39298]]
Seeing as the World Serpent absolutely abhors the fat dobber, he was probably sick of looking at it.
*102833*
[[S:::42430-46380]]
Well, he and Thor have a bit of an unpleasant history between them…
*102834*
[[S:::46760-47800]]
or they will, anyway.
*102835*
[[S:::48420-54030]]
So I guess waking up to see it was worse than the thought of lumps of solid stone passing through his gullet.
*102836*
[[S:::54680-55580]]
You want me to ask him?
*102837*
[[S:::67510-69270]]
All right, wish me luck!
*102839*
[[S:::74004-79985]]
Yooooooor-moooooooo hin meeee-meeeeeeeeer.
*102840*
[[S:::86120-89089]]
I’ve still got it, lads. He remembers me.
*102841*
[[S:::89562-91328]]
Lyoooooooooo—
*102842*
[[S:::91530-93174]]
Oh no!That’s not it! Uh…
*102843*
[[S:::93599-99873]]
Maaaaaw-lon-gooooo vih-nooooor kooooon tooooon kooooon.
*102844*
[[S:::101334-103577]]
Oh, dear.
*102845*
[[S:::103773-110344]]
Ehhhhhh-kooooo… noooooh oh-thooooo voo-nooooor…
*102846*
[[S:::119143-120777]]
He knows the pain of your loss.
*102847*
[[S:::121328-122238]]
He will help you.
*102848*
[[S:::130611-134285]]
Efni… ooooo-fooooon-goooor.
*102849*
[[S:::135000-135900]]
Curious…
*102850*
[[S:::137597-139783]]
Ohhh… Nothing to be concerned about.
*102851*
[[S:::142900-144800]]
Making sure we’re heading in the right direction.
*102852*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl06_s340_010_kra_stem:55910-56440]]
No.
*102853*
[[S:::57080-58730]]
Our only concern is Jötunheim.
*102854*
[[S:::136260-136750]]
What is it?
*102855*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl06_s365_010_kra_stem:790-1590]]
Atreus…
*102856*
[[S:::6630-8040]]
I know how to read, boy.
*102857*
[[S:::8630-9590]]
Just not this tongue.
*102858*
[[S:::18710-19150]]
Wait.
*102859*
[[S:::22020-22580]]
Not that.
*102860*
[[S:::24380-25470]]
Do you smell something?
*102861*
[[S:::54550-55650]]
Arrrgh!
*102862*
[[S:::62750-66000]]
ARRRGH!
*102863*
[[S:::94000-96000]]
Rrrrgh!
*102864*
[[S:::111800-113100]]
RAAAAAAAA!!!
*102865*
[[S:::146000-147000]]
Atreus…
*102866*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl06_s365_010_son_stem:2050-6210]]
Come on. You already speak it. Learning to read won’t be that hard.
*102867*
[[S:::10440-15410]]
You’re halfway there already then. Okay… so the runes represent a lot of different things.
*102868*
[[S:::15410-19500]]
Some gods, some animals, and some are—
*102869*
[[S:::20000-22670]]
Oh, am I going too fast? Sorry I’ll—
*102870*
[[S:::29500-32270]]
Yeah, I do. Smells like—
*102871*
[[S:::35040-35580]]
rain?
*102872*
[[S:::58650-59550]]
No!
*102873*
[[S:::61640-62620]]
Þruma—!!
*102874*
[[S:::73000-74500]]
Shut up!
*102875*
[[S:::80530-84530]]
You don’t… know anything… about my mother.
*102876*
[[S:::94800-96130]]
STOP IT!
*102877*
[[S:::98000-99700]]
RAAAAAAAA—!!!
*102878*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl06_s365_010_mdi_stem:41710-43110]]
You ruined everything.
*102879*
[[S:::43860-45320]]
I earned that fucking hammer,
*102880*
[[S:::46170-51160]]
but now everyone’s gonna think I only got it ’cause Magni’s gone.
*102881*
[[S:::51230-52880]]
I’ll be a joke.
*102882*
[[S:::53900-55250]]
But if I kill you——
*102883*
[[S:::56250-58000]]
no one’s gonna laugh at me.
*102884*
[[S:::66510-67290]]
Wow, are you dumb.
*102885*
[[S:::68040-73350]]
That your father’s doing or did you get it from your mom? She stupid and ugly?
*102886*
[[S:::84530-91760]]
Oh that’s true. But I’m gonna get to know you really well. You’re gonna be my new brother.…
*102887*
[[S:::92130-94810]]
right after I finish killing your father.
*102888*
[[S:::101750-104440]]
Whoops… I think I broke him.
*102889*
[[S:::115210-116330]]
Stay back!
*102890*
[[S:::132610-133280]]
No…
*102891*
[[S:::137600-138780]]
This isn’t over!
*102892*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl06_s365_010_mmr_stem:143480-144480]]
Brother… the boy.
*102893*
[[S:::150020-152500]]
You have to get him to Freya quickly! There’s no other way.
*102894*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_010_mmr:0-790]]
What now then?
*102895*
[[S:::1350-3000]]
Maybe Freya ought to have a look at the boy.
*102896*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_030_son:0-1320]]
No, I feel better now.
*102897*
[[S:::1730-3150]]
I just needed to catch my breath.
*102898*
[[S:::3740-4600]]
Where do we go next?
*102899*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_040_mmr:0-2535]]
Well, now that we’ve got the Giant’s chisel,
*102900*
[[S:::2535-7520]]
we need to learn the travel rune to Jötunheim so we can carve it into that special gateway atop the peak,
*102901*
[[S:::7520-10000]]
and open realm travel to the land of the Giants.
*102902*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_050_son:0-440]]
You don’t know it?
*102903*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_060_mmr:520-1390]]
Alas, no—
*102904*
[[S:::1900-6000]]
but the Serpent did mention that the Giants had entrusted that secret to Týr.
*102905*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_070_son:28-889]]
Isn’t Týr dead?
*102906*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_100_mmr:20-3010]]
Aye, but his hidden vault is very much in reach.
*102907*
[[S:::3680-5139]]
The doors are beneath his temple,
*102908*
[[S:::5509-9749]]
submerged in the lake for generations until our snake-friend shifted his weight.
*102909*
[[S:::10329-13120]]
There we shall find the fabled “Black Rune of Jötunheim”…
*102910*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_100_mmr_a:110-780]]
Aye,
*102911*
[[S:::1270-3660]]
but his hidden vault is very much in reach.
*102912*
[[S:::4060-9190]]
The doors are beneath his temple, submerged in the lake for generations
*102913*
[[S:::9190-10120]]
until our snake-friend shifted his weight.
*102914*
[[S:::10660-14000]]
There we shall find the fabled “Black Rune of Jötunheim”…
*102915*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_110_son:174-1499]]
We could also explore some more.
*102916*
[[S:::2054-3135]]
We got that chisel now,
*102917*
[[S:::3492-4914]]
and that vault isn't going anywhere.
*102918*
[[S:::5301-6811]]
Seems a shame to waste the boat.
*102919*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl06_s010_120_kra:20-750]]
We shall see, boy.
*102920*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s020_010_son:75-2612]]
Oooh… Týr’s vault is behind that magical lock!
*102921*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s020_020_son:30-560]]
Oooh…
*102922*
[[S:::1000-3600]]
I bet Týr’s vault is behind that magical lock we saw earlier!
*102923*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s020_030_mmr:160-2300]]
That’s right, lad. It’s on the other side of the bridge.
*102924*
[[S:::2710-5000]]
Head across, then take the stairs all the way down.
*102925*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl06_s020_040_kra:34-2481]]
Head—the entrance to the hidden vault.
*102926*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s020_050_mmr:133-3951]]
It’s on the other side of the bridge. Head across, then take the stairs all the way down.
*102927*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s030_010_mmr:170-3243]]
The entrance to Týr’s vault is at the bottom of these stairs—
*102928*
[[S:::3243-5750]]
whenever you decide it’s time to go after the Black Rune, yeah?
*102929*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s040_010_mmr:80-4250]]
Týr’s vault is at the bottom of those stairs—just take them all the way to the bottom.
*102930*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s050_010_mmr:0-1250]]
Brother—the chisel…
*102931*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s060_010_son:50-670]]
Wow.
*102932*
[[S:::1125-3124]]
I can’t believe we’re setting foot in Týr’s vault!
*102933*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s070_010_son:60-1250]]
Another shrine to a Giant—but it’s got a panel missing!
*102934*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s080_010_son:70-1210]]
It’s Týr!
*102935*
[[S:::1650-2930]]
But… the middle panel is missing.
*102936*
[[S:::3360-3630]]
Wait,
*102937*
[[S:::4060-5070]]
I thought Týr was a god,
*102938*
[[S:::5470-6000]]
not a giant.
*102939*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s080_020_mmr:60-650]]
Aye.
*102940*
[[S:::1000-3350]]
But he was loved by everyone, including the giants.
*102941*
[[S:::3870-7500]]
Other than me, he was the only one they gifted with their special sight.
*102942*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s080_030_mmr:0-3500]]
Hey… I wonder if the giants left a triptych about me somewhere too?
*102943*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl06_s090_010_kra:28-653]]
Go ahead.
*102944*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s090_020_son:80-1430]]
Actually… come look.
*102945*
[[S:::1920-3160]]
Let me show you how to read this.
*102946*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl06_s090_030_kra:0-1000]]
That is not necess—
*102947*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s090_040_son:0-1400]]
You’ve taught me so much.
*102948*
[[S:::1810-3000]]
Let me teach you something.
*102949*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl06_s090_050_son:44-2893]]
What if you need to use one and I’m not there? This’ll be fun!
*102950*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_010_mdi:0-3680]]
Grandfather has much to discuss with your boy.
*102951*
[[S:::4670-6500]]
It won’t be pleasant.
*102952*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_020_mdi:18-3429]]
Don’t worry. I’ll keep an eye on him.
*102953*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_030_mdi:65-2121]]
Stay down! It’s over.
*102954*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_040_mdi:40-1750]]
Just die already!
*102955*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_050_mdi:47-1303]]
Impossible!
*102956*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_060_mdi:32-1092]]
Don’t come any closer!
*102957*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_070_mdi:60-1250]]
Fall, damn you!
*102958*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_080_mdi:49-1833]]
Why won’t you die!?
*102959*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_090_mdi:0-950]]
I thought so.
*102960*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_100_mdi:0-1960]]
And then there was one…
*102961*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_110_mdi:50-4500]]
The halls of Asgard will sing with my name!
*102962*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_cl06_s105_120_mdi:170-3050]]
I’ve avenged you, brother!
*102963*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl06_s110_010_kra:19-597]]
Atreus…
*102964*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s110_020_mmr:30-2750]]
You have to get him to Freya, quickly. There’s no other way.
*102965*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s120_010_mmr:52-2131]]
Take the boat. Freya’s isn’t far.
*102966*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl06_s130_010_kra:220-1250]]
I need to help my son.
*102967*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl06_s130_020_kra:43-1318]]
I need to help Atreus.
*102968*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl06_s130_030_kra:56-1233]]
I must go to Freya.
*102969*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s140_010_mmr:110-4270]]
Odin’s eye is on you, brother. Especially now that you’ve taken to killing his kin.
*102970*
[[S:::5040-8880]]
Freya’s forest is a blind spot for him. This is our smartest move.
*102971*
[[S:::9390-10710]]
And if anyone can heal him,
*102972*
[[S:::11170-11680]]
it’s her.
*102973*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl06_s140_020_kra:0-1250]]
What is happening to him?
*102974*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s140_030_mmr:70-5010]]
I’ve seen it in mortals, that some conflict of the mind expresses itself as an ailment of the body.
*102975*
[[S:::5530-6700]]
Never in a God,
*102976*
[[S:::7280-9990]]
but… a God believing himself mortal?
*102977*
[[S:::10590-11750]]
I can only imagine…
*102978*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl06_s140_040_mmr:66-1122]]
We’re almost there.
*102980*
[[S::vo_lvl_clrv_s430_010_kra_stem:5060-5880]]
Boy.
*102981*
[[S:::8850-9450]]
Here.
*102982*
[[S:::14320-15758]]
On the day you were born,
*102983*
[[S:::16460-17770]]
I made two knives,
*102984*
[[S:::18600-21477]]
mixing metals from my home and from this land.
*102985*
[[S:::22770-23936]]
One for myself,
*102986*
[[S:::25020-26445]]
and when you were ready,
*102987*
[[S:::27160-28303]]
one for you.
*102988*
[[S:::29560-31119]]
Today is that day.
*102989*
[[S:::39230-40217]]
No.
*102990*
[[S:::41530-42961]]
We are not men.
*102991*
[[S:::44000-45509]]
We are more than that.
*102992*
[[S:::46050-48527]]
The responsibility is far greater.
*102993*
[[S:::51906-57465]]
And you must be better than me. Understand?
*102994*
[[S:::59628-60928]]
Say it.
*102995*
[[S:::67628-72929]]
The power of this weapon, any weapon, comes from here…
*102996*
[[S:::73998-75993]]
… but only when tempered by this.
*102997*
[[S:::77019-80984]]
By the discipline, the self-control, of the one who wields it.
*102998*
[[S:::81807-84872]]
That is where the true strength of a warrior lies.
*102999*
[[S:::86570-88398]]
You must never forget that.
*103000*
[[S:::92957-96191]]
Good then. Come.
*103001*
[[S:::114315-115252]]
Blank.
*103002*
[[S:::128753-130439]]
The rune! Did you see it?!
*103003*
[[S:::131596-132525]]
Are you certain?
*103004*
[[S:::134682-137066]]
Good then. Aim for the face!
*103005*
[[S::vo_lvl_clrv_s430_010_son_stem:36860-37992]]
So I’m a man now,
*103006*
[[S:::38580-39200]]
like you.
*103007*
[[S:::62120-63494]]
I will be better.
*103008*
[[S:::103240-104327]]
Dreifa.
*103009*
[[S:::119380-120164]]
Wait…
*103010*
[[S:::130910-131596]]
Yes!
*103011*
[[S:::132602-134407]]
I got it. Trust me.
*103012*
[[S::vo_lvl_clrv_s425_010_son_stem:7030-8300]]
Wow.
*103013*
[[S:::13600-14470]]
Look at that!
*103014*
[[S:::78680-79580]]
What’d you find—?
*103015*
[[S:::89220-90020]]
Okay…
*103016*
[[S::vo_lvl_clrv_s425_010_kra_stem:82170-83100]]
Enough distraction.
*103017*
[[S:::84300-85750]]
Do not forget why we are here.
*103018*
[[S::vo_lvl_clrv_s440_010_kra_stem:21500-21920]]
Sit.
*103019*
[[S:::32050-32820]]
Lemnian wine.
*103020*
[[S:::33540-34970]]
From the island of Lemnos,
*103021*
[[S:::35740-37570]]
near the place of my birth.
*103022*
[[S:::55030-56090]]
To a journey’s end.
*103023*
[[S:::67390-67750]]
Possibly.
*103024*
[[S:::88780-90410]]
Aaaah…
*103025*
[[S:::139980-140660]]
Yes.
*103026*
[[S:::156090-156530]]
Ready?
*103027*
[[S:::159960-160340]]
Come.
*103028*
[[S::vo_lvl_clrv_s440_010_son_stem:0-890]]
Jörð…
*103029*
[[S:::18590-20090]]
We’re so close to the end…
*103030*
[[S:::48460-50700]]
“Lemnos”…
*103031*
[[S:::58620-59210]]
Really?
*103032*
[[S:::63180-66670]]
Smells like rotten eggs. Is it still good?
*103033*
[[S:::91740-93580]]
Aaaah…
*103034*
[[S:::112890-116420]]
Father? Why did you leave your home and come here?
*103035*
[[S:::118480-119800]]
Does it have to do with the other gods there?
*103036*
[[S:::123870-127290]]
It’s just… you hate the gods so much.
*103037*
[[S:::128290-131810]]
But Týr proves that gods can be good. And you’re good.
*103038*
[[S:::132920-134740]]
You only killed those deserving, right?
*103039*
[[S:::144430-147320]]
Quiet, head. We are. We know better.
*103040*
[[S:::157470-157860]]
Ready.
*103041*
[[S:::164210-165810]]
I think I’m going to like being a god…
*103042*
[[S::vo_lvl_clrv_s440_010_mmr_stem:140980-141400]]
Ah,
*103043*
[[S:::141830-144390]]
but who’s worthy enough to judge?
*103044*
[[S:::148390-148830]]
Huh.
*103045*
[[S:::149580-151750]]
Sounding more like your da’ by the moment.
*103046*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_001_son:37-4513]]
I wish I’d known I was a god in Alfheim… I wouldn’t have felt so bad about killing so many Elves.
*103047*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_002_mmr:75-2250]]
Well, I’m not sure that’s the lesson…
*103048*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_003_kra:150-1610]]
You’ve done nothing to regret.
*103049*
[[S:::1960-4000]]
The Elves forced their affairs upon us..
*103050*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_004_son:30-1020]]
No, I get it now.
*103051*
[[S:::1520-2810]]
We had god things to do,
*103052*
[[S:::3250-4090]]
and they were in the way,
*103053*
[[S:::4600-6250]]
dragging us into their little problems.
*103054*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_005_mmr:0-2000]]
Again, are we just leaving that there…?
*103055*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_006_son:190-530]]
I mean,
*103056*
[[S:::880-3150]]
just knowing we’re gods makes me feel so much…
*103057*
[[S:::3510-4000]]
stronger.
*103058*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_006_mmr:50-300]]
Eh…
*103059*
[[S:::880-2500]]
laddy, up on the wall there.
*103060*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_007_mmr:0-2630]]
Maybe you feel a little too good right now.
*103061*
[[S:::2630-9000]]
With power comes a big choice, lad. You can either serve yourself or put your godhood in the service of others.
*103062*
[[S:::9000-9870]]
Like Týr did.
*103063*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_010_son:0-1000]]
People really loved him, huh?
*103064*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_020_mmr:30-2230]]
Aye. A god of war…
*103065*
[[S:::2610-4180]]
but one who fought for peace.
*103066*
[[S:::4950-7670]]
Had a reputation for being heroic and lawful,
*103067*
[[S:::8120-11910]]
using his power and knowledge to stop wars, rather than start them.
*103068*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_030_son:0-1250]]
So there are good gods…
*103069*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_040_mmr:120-2250]]
Once in a moon, it’s been known to happen, yes.
*103070*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_050_son:160-4300]]
This one mentions places I’ve never even heard of.  Seems Týr really liked to travel.
*103071*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_060_mmr:50-4764]]
Týr believed the mind, not might, was key to preventing war and chaos.
*103072*
[[S:::4764-9948]]
And he also knew visiting other cultures would give him perspective staying in one place could not.
*103073*
[[S:::10210-13580]]
While Odin always hoarded knowledge, guarding it jealously,
*103074*
[[S:::14050-17040]]
Týr was open and sharing with his learning and his wisdom.
*103075*
[[S:::17660-19660]]
For this, mortals adored Týr—
*103076*
[[S:::20200-22920]]
showing their love by bringing him gifts the world over.
*103077*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_070_son:20-1860]]
So what ever happened to Týr?
*103078*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_080_mmr:0-2530]]
Odin came to regard him as a threat to his rule…
*103079*
[[S:::2930-8460]]
he suspected Týr of collaborating to aid the Giants instead of helping to steal their secrets for the Aesir.
*103080*
[[S:::8960-10750]]
Same thing he accused me of, frankly—
*103081*
[[S:::11260-13250]]
though in Týr’s case, I believe he was right.
*103082*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_090_son:20-1500]]
You think Týr was helping the Giants?
*103083*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_090_son_a:43-1604]]
So, what happened to this temple?
*103084*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_100_mmr:0-550]]
I do.
*103085*
[[S:::1090-4230]]
He felt responsible for the suffering visited upon them by Odin.
*103086*
[[S:::4660-8000]]
I suspect he had something to do with helping them cover their tracks.
*103087*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_110_son:88-1410]]
The missing Jötunheim tower!
*103088*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s030_120_mmr:30-890]]
Correct.
*103089*
[[S:::1240-4300]]
Whatever happened to it, I believe it could only have been done
*103090*
[[S:::4300-6250]]
with Týr and the Giants working together.
*103091*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s040_010_kra:60-2000]]
Where is this Black Rune, Head?
*103092*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s040_020_mmr:40-1850]]
Don’t know. I’ve never been in here.
*103093*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s050_010_son:1-1860]]
The stone!  That has to be it!
*103094*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s050_020_son:14-2068]]
Naturally.
*103095*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s050_030_mmr:27-1662]]
Didn’t think it would be that easy?
*103096*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s050_040_son:48-583]]
No.
*103097*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s050_040_son_a:140-450]]
No.
*103098*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s050_050_son:25-1206]]
Was kind of hoping though…
*103099*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s050_060_son:90-730]]
So what now?
*103100*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s060_010_son:49-2919]]
That’s gonna come to life and try to kill us at some point, huh?
*103101*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s060_020_kra:0-750]]
Most likely.
*103102*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s060_030_mmr:0-1870]]
Our boy is catching on, isn’t he?
*103103*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s070_010_mmr:0-2000]]
Brother, up there—the Winds of Hel.
*103104*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s070_020_son:33-982]]
The winds of what?
*103105*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s070_030_mmr:0-1230]]
Oh… we forget to mention that?
*103106*
[[S:::1850-4250]]
When you were sick, we went to Helheim to get your cure.
*103107*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s070_040_son:54-937]]
You did?
*103108*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s070_050_mmr:0-1850]]
Terrible experience, by the by.
*103109*
[[S:::2240-5250]]
Your da’ picked up a new trick though… with a little help from Brok.
*103110*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s070_060_son:140-1100]]
Brok was there too!?!
*103111*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s070_070_son:130-1150]]
I… but…
*103112*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s070_080_son:67-1996]]
We’ll get back to this later.
*103113*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s070_090_mmr:0-1920]]
Brother… a trap for the Winds of Hel.
*103114*
[[S:::2300-3500]]
But where do you think the Winds are?
*103115*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrv_s075_010_mmr:0-1500]]
Move it or you may lose it, brother.
*103116*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s080_010_son:58-1335]]
Well that’s unfriendly.
*103117*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s090_010_son:50-1086]]
How’d you know that was there?
*103118*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s090_020_kra:19-841]]
Experience.
*103119*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s100_010_mmr:60-3500]]
Look. Small passages on either side. Perfect for the boy.
*103120*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s100_020_son:220-1500]]
It’s too small for father though.
*103121*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s100_030_kra:0-490]]
Go.
*103122*
[[S:::860-1500]]
I will be fine.
*103123*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s100_040_son:70-300]]
But—
*103124*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s100_050_kra:15-465]]
Go.
*103125*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s110_010_mmr:30-3500]]
Careful, brother. Freya’s not here to bring you back if you’re cut in two.
*103126*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s110_020_kra:13-974]]
Quiet, Head.
*103127*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s120_010_son:64-802]]
You made it!
*103128*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s130_010_mmr:70-4000]]
That’s from a great desert land very far from here.
*103129*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s130_020_son:30-1010]]
Do gods live there?
*103130*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s130_030_mmr:0-2930]]
Oh my, yes… many, many gods.
*103131*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s130_040_son:40-710]]
Good or bad?
*103132*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s130_050_mmr:170-2240]]
Not as simple as that, I’m afraid…
*103133*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s130_050_mmr_a:0-2000]]
Not as simple as that, I’m afraid…
*103134*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s140_010_mmr:0-440]]
Ah…
*103135*
[[S:::1030-3600]]
a sgian-dubh from my homeland.
*103136*
[[S:::3690-5590]]
Used to have one of my own back in the day.
*103137*
[[S:::6120-7000]]
You should take it, boy!
*103138*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s140_020_kra:0-1560]]
Yes, boy… take it.
*103139*
[[S:::2010-4250]]
We might need to butter bread somewhere on our travels.
*103140*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s140_030_mmr:0-1500]]
This is why no one likes you.
*103141*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s140_030_mmr_a:70-1750]]
This is why no one likes you.
*103142*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s150_010_son:200-2150]]
What did you see in the vault that set you off?
*103143*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s150_020_kra:120-1000]]
It is not important.
*103144*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s150_030_son:21-1655]]
Seemed important to you.
*103145*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s150_040_kra:50-1370]]
It was a rash impulse.
*103146*
[[S:::2110-4250]]
You need not dwell on my failings.
*103147*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s150_050_son:80-600]]
Wow.
*103148*
[[S:::1100-2290]]
That was almost an apology.
*103149*
[[S:::2820-4940]]
Well, I guess you do like to smash pottery.
*103150*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrv_s150_060_mmr:15-512]]
Ha!
*103151*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s155_010_mmr:0-4250]]
Stands to reason the second ring should behave like the first. Just need to capture the Winds…
*103152*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s160_010_son:48-7800]]
Look, I just want to know the truth from now on, okay?  I don’t care if it hurts me or not. I want to learn.
*103153*
[[S:::7800-10696]]
Just ’cause you hate being a god doesn’t mean I have to.
*103154*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s170_010_mmr:0-1250]]
More small passages.
*103155*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s170_020_son:60-510]]
I know…
*103156*
[[S:::1240-1500]]
“go.”
*103157*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s170_030_mmr:0-1840]]
I can’t watch, brother. Good luck!
*103158*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s180_010_son:1100-2480]]
And I thought the saws were scary.
*103159*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s180_020_son:98-3350]]
Look!  It’s the wolf-giants, Sköll and Hati!
*103160*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s180_030_mmr:70-2500]]
That’s right, “the bringers of day and night.”
*103161*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s180_040_son:170-2310]]
Ragnarök begins when they catch the sun and moon,
*103162*
[[S:::2980-3350]]
right?
*103163*
[[S:::4350-5110]]
Did Týr know them?
*103164*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s180_050_mmr:59-4255]]
I don’t know. Liked them well enough to cover a massive wall in his vault with them though.
*103165*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s190_010_son:0-1500]]
I don’t see another trap for the… uh…
*103166*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s190_020_mmr:50-780]]
“Winds of Hel?”
*103167*
[[S:::1330-4000]]
Maybe we can get up to one of those balconies for a better look?
*103168*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s200_010_son:45-9130]]
Don’t you enjoy it at all? Being a god? Out on an adventure in some amazing place?
*103169*
[[S:::9130-17269]]
Maybe mother wanted us to have a little fun. Everything we’ve seen and done… maybe it was her gift.
*103170*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s210_010_son:69-1865]]
Look! There’s the wind trap!
*103171*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s220_010_son:42-1491]]
I think we can get down here.
*103172*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrv_s220_020_mmr:0-520]]
Aye,
*103173*
[[S:::1070-4000]]
but the winds of Hel will not endure long enough to cover that distance.
*103174*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrv_s225_010_mmr:0-610]]
Ahh—
*103175*
[[S:::1190-1750]]
clever.
*103176*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s230_010_son:130-580]]
You know…
*103177*
[[S:::1120-3500]]
for someone so loved, Týr sure was paranoid.
*103178*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s230_020_mmr:990-3000]]
Thanks to Odin—with good reason.
*103179*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_010_son:19-2000]]
The runestone—it’s lowering!
*103180*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_020_kra:8-460]]
ARRRGH!
*103181*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_030_son:164-1002]]
What’s going on?!?
*103182*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_040_kra:24-563]]
Trap…
*103183*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_050_son:131-755]]
Father!
*103184*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_060_kra:0-510]]
Boy!
*103185*
[[S:::870-1500]]
Get out of here!
*103186*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_070_son:220-2040]]
I’m fine! How do we get you out?
*103187*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_080_kra:40-1500]]
Pull chains… on the wall.
*103188*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_090_son:151-3096]]
But… there are three of them! What do I do?!?!
*103189*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_100_kra:0-2230]]
Atreus… focus. You can do this.
*103190*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_110_mmr:50-2450]]
Please hurry! I don’t know yet if I can drown.
*103191*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_120_son:90-5400]]
Okay… think. Hati’s the silver one. He hunts the moon. Sköll’s gold and he chases the sun.
*103192*
[[S:::5400-8870]]
For Ragnarök to happen, they have to eat them. But these are out of order.
*103193*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_130_kra:0-600]]
Good boy.
*103194*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_140_son:260-4700]]
So the moon goes on the left… sun on the right, with Midgard in the middle. But which bar do I pull?
*103195*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_141_son:64-4140]]
Gotta get them in order: Moon, left… sun, right… with  Midgard in the middle.
*103196*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_141_son_a:25-2827]]
Moon on the left, sun on the right, Midgard in the middle.
*103197*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_141_son_e:48-4151]]
Gotta get them in order: Moon, left… sun, right… with  Midgard in the middle.
*103198*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_141_son_b:220-2470]]
Moon, Midgard, Sun. Moon, Midgard, Sun. Think!
*103200*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_141_son_d:100-1850]]
Moon, Midgard, Sun.
*103201*
[[S:::2620-4560]]
Moon, Midgard, Sun. Think!
*103202*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_141_son_c:45-2900]]
Moon on the left, sun on the right, Midgard in the middle.
*103203*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_150_kra:26-637]]
The left!
*103204*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_160_kra:0-500]]
Left, boy!

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_150_kra_a:32-654]]

Middle bar!

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_180_kra_a:31-827]]
Middle bar!

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_190_kra:34-585]]
The middle!

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_180_kra_b:12-883]]
Middle bar!

Middle, quickly!

*103222*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_220_kra_b:0-750]]
The right, boy!
*103223*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_230_kra:10-434]]
Right!
*103224*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_230_kra_a:12-441]]
Right!
*103225*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_240_mmr:81-1598]]
Water’s at your knees, brother!
*103226*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_250_mmr:7-1165]]
It’s at your arse!
*103227*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_260_mmr:87-1773]]
It’s up to my—
*103228*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_280_son:19-1130]]
The water! Gotta hurry!
*103229*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_290_son:155-1332]]
FATHER! NO!!!
*103230*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s240_300_son:25-858]]
We did it!
*103231*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s250_010_son:318-3617]]
We’re not stopping!  Wait… what’s that big chain fo—
*103232*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s250_020_son:56-1327]]
Father! Above you!
*103233*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s250_030_kra:0-2000]]
Boy!  You have to stop that chain!
*103234*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s250_040_son:100-732]]
HOW!?!
*103235*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s250_050_kra:0-430]]
I…
*103236*
[[S:::980-1750]]
I do not know!
*103237*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s250_041_son:100-3300]]
Uhhh…come on…come on, there’s got to be something I can…
*103238*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s250_060_son:0-1100]]
Wait!  I know what to do!
*103239*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s250_070_kra:43-599]]
Her knife?
*103240*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s250_080_son:54-1076]]
There’s no other way!
*103241*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s250_090_son:38-2642]]
It’s not working! That should have worked!
*103242*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s260_010_mmr:60-2850]]
Well, I can’t drown. Guess that’s something.
*103243*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s260_020_kra:50-500]]
Her knife…
*103244*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s260_030_son:70-440]]
I know…
*103245*
[[S:::1740-2470]]
but it saved you.
*103246*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s260_040_kra:170-1000]]
That was cunning, boy.
*103247*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s265_010_son:90-2284]]
The rune’s free! I think we did it.
*103248*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrv_s265_020_mmr:27-2568]]
Aye—let’s go see what Týr’s got for us.
*103249*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s270_010_son:0-5550]]
Oh, no… Freya’s protection rune— it rubbed off! What should we do?
*103250*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s270_020_kra:80-1000]]
We keep going.
*103251*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s280_010_kra:18-519]]
Boy…
*103252*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s280_020_son:100-1290]]
Metals from your home, you said…
*103253*
[[S:::2140-2460]]
Hunh!
*103254*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s280_030_son:28-798]]
Jörð…
*103255*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s290_010_son:20-2000]]
We can’t leave here without the black rune.
*103256*
[[S:::2000-4020]]
C’mon, we can do this.
*103257*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s222_010_kra:20-750]]
What of these?
*103258*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s222_020_son:60-1500]]
“Thought is faster than wind.”
*103259*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s222_030_mmr:0-2790]]
Something to be solved with our heads rather than our feet.
*103260*
[[S:::3260-4250]]
Suits me fine!
*103261*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s222_040_mmr:40-2930]]
Solving problems with our heads rather than our feet.
*103262*
[[S:::3300-4240]]
Suits me fine!
*103263*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s222_050_mmr:23-5091]]
Hm… perhaps this isn’t about speed at all. Is there someplace else the winds can go?
*103264*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clrv_s222_060_mmr:0-3000]]
Ah. A timely hint for something we figured out ourselves!
*103265*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s275_010_son:0-630]]
Whew!
*103266*
[[S:::1610-2490]]
He was big.
*103267*
[[S:::3420-4750]]
But no match for us gods…
*103268*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrv_s275_020_kra:33-1338]]
I have beaten bigger.
*103269*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrv_s275_030_son:0-240]]
Heh…
*103270*
[[S:::830-1500]]
“Puny troll!”…
*103271*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrv_s275_040_mmr:0-1120]]
Yeeeah…
*103272*
[[S:::1630-4500]]
I’m turned around, which way is the sandbowl back up?
*103273*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv06_s370_010_kra_stem:39-1274]]
Freya!
*103274*
[[S:::1717-2994]]
Open the door!
*103275*
[[S:::3492-4658]]
We need your help!
*103276*
[[S:::6376-7652]]
Woman, do you hear me?
*103277*
[[S:::8373-9315]]
It is urgent!
*103278*
[[S:::12420-13917]]
The boy has fallen ill!
*103279*
[[S:::14858-15747]]
Freya!
*103280*
[[S:::19018-19850]]
He is ill.
*103281*
[[S:::39867-41253]]
I did this to him…?
*103282*
[[S:::43748-44580]]
Will you help me?
*103283*
[[S:::58220-58885]]
Hel…
*103284*
[[S:::61047-61934]]
Not this one…
*103285*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv06_s370_010_fre_stem:9850-12143]]
I am still a god! Go away.
*103286*
[[S:::22343-22955]]
Inside.
*103287*
[[S:::24900-26780]]
This is no ordinary illness.
*103288*
[[S:::27160-30740]]
The boy’s true nature, your true nature, fights within him.
*103289*
[[S:::47456-47990]]
Of course…
*103290*
[[S:::49590-52590]]
There is a rare ingredient found only in Helheim.
*103291*
[[S:::53030-56180]]
The keeper that protects the Bridge of The Damned… I need its heart.
*103292*
[[S:::58770-60604]]
The Realm of the Dead. Do you know it?
*103293*
[[S:::63050-64818]]
It is a land of unyielding cold.
*103294*
[[S:::65701-70797]]
Fires cannot burn there, and no magic in all the nine realms can create a blaze.
*103295*
[[S:::70972-74299]]
As for the dead… your frost axe will be useless.
*103296*
[[S:::74854-76013]]
You’ll need to find something else.
*103297*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv06_s370_010_son_stem:33858-34681]]
(sickly moan)
*103298*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv06_s370_020_kra_stem:2550-3918]]
Then I must return home…
*103299*
[[S:::8110-9771]]
...dig up a past I swore
*103300*
[[S:::10100-11139]]
would stay buried.
*103301*
[[S:::35010-35588]]
Boy…
*103302*
[[S:::60010-60655]]
Freya…
*103303*
[[S:::62860-64420]]
When last we spoke… I was…
*103304*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv06_s370_020_fre_stem:12220-13990]]
Who you were before doesn’t matter.
*103305*
[[S:::15430-17670]]
This boy is not your past, he is your son…
*103306*
[[S:::18550-20180]]
and he needs his father.
*103307*
[[S:::24220-26470]]
This rune opens the bridge to Helheim.
*103308*
[[S:::27020-31107]]
When you are there, do not under any circumstances cross the Bridge of The Damned.
*103309*
[[S:::31107-33138]]
There is no road back. Understand?
*103310*
[[S:::35866-36320]]
Heimili!
*103311*
[[S:::37250-38090]]
You must hurry.
*103312*
[[S:::38770-41468]]
Through my garden there’s a path leading to my boat. Take it.
*103313*
[[S:::41468-44799]]
Return home. Dig up your past. Do whatever you need to do.
*103314*
[[S:::44855-47409]]
Just bring me back the bridge keeper’s heart,
*103315*
[[S:::47611-49020]]
and your son may survive.
*103316*
[[S:::50500-51013]]
Now…
*103317*
[[S:::64554-69352]]
No. You are right to distrust the word of a god.
*103318*
[[S:::69927-72998]]
No need to explain. Not to me. Not for that.
*103319*
[[S:::75040-79213]]
I will keep him safe. That’s a mother’s promise.
*103320*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv06_s370_020_son_stem:33858-34681]]
(groan)
*103321*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv06_s375_010_kra_stem:78468-83997]]
Athena…
*103322*
[[S:::90036-92822]]
Get out of my head.
*103323*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv06_s010_010_mmr:220-1750]]
Somebody just called the serpent.
*103324*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_riv06_s020_010_fre:40-2930]]
Use the garden door—my boat is down the path.
*103325*
[[S:::3900-4300]]
Go…
*103326*
[[S:::5040-6000]]
time is not our friend.
*103327*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv06_s015_010_kra:50-1340]]
The fever burns hotter.
*103328*
[[S:::1760-2500]]
He is shaking.
*103329*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv06_s015_020_mmr:157-1706]]
It’s serious. We must hurry.
*103330*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv06_s015_030_kra:101-879]]
Atreus…
*103331*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv06_s030_010_mmr:0-1750]]
Helheim, of all places…
*103332*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv06_s030_020_mmr:0-860]]
You alright, brother?
*103333*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv06_s030_030_kra:40-1580]]
I will do what I must.
*103334*
[[S:::2000-2827]]
Leave me be.
*103335*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv06_s030_040_mmr:0-730]]
As you wish.
*103336*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv06_s030_050_mmr:12-1684]]
Oughtn’t we get to the boat, brother?
*103337*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro02_s380_010_ath_stem:92470-95540]]
There’s nowhere you can hide, Spartan.
*103338*
[[S:::96470-100550]]
Put as much distance between you and the truth as you want,
*103339*
[[S:::101560-103300]]
it changes nothing.
*103340*
[[S:::104730-106900]]
Pretend to be everything you are not…
*103341*
[[S:::107940-108660]]
teacher…
*103342*
[[S:::109410-110380]]
husband…
*103343*
[[S:::112500-113120]]
father…
*103344*
[[S:::116450-120440]]
… but there is one unavoidable truth you will never escape:
*103345*
[[S:::122100-123570]]
You cannot change.
*103346*
[[S:::125210-127350]]
You will always be
*103347*
[[S:::128440-129250]]
a monster.
*103348*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro02_s380_010_kra_stem:132710-133270]]
I know.
*103349*
[[S:::136670-138940]]
But I am your monster no longer.
*103350*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pro02_s010_010_mmr:100-2250]]
Alright, brother… let’s see what those blades can do.
*103351*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pro02_s020_010_mmr:90-4270]]
My, yes… those blades will serve quite well in Helheim. And might do more besides—
*103352*
[[S:::4640-8000]]
try using them to ignite that icy bramble there, covering the travel stones.
*103353*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pro02_s020_010_mmr_a:60-2830]]
My, yes… those blades will serve quite well in Helheim.
*103354*
[[S:::3250-7670]]
Now, I believe I see a door to the Realm Between Realms over there—in your front yard no less!
*103355*
[[S:::8170-11250]]
Take the shortcut back to the realm travel temple, then on to Helheim, yeah?
*103356*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pro02_s020_020_mmr:30-4250]]
Brother—that icy bramble, covering the travel stones. Use your blades to clear it away.
*103357*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pro02_s020_030_mmr:50-3541]]
That icy bramble outside, brother—covering the travel stones.
*103358*
[[S:::3541-5250]]
Get back out there and use your blades to clear it away.
*103359*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pro02_s020_030_mmr_a:0-2110]]
Brother… there’s no path to the temple in here.
*103360*
[[S:::2570-5000]]
The door to the Realm Between Realms is outside.
*103361*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pro02_s020_040_mmr:70-2810]]
Those blades must indeed be hot to burn Hel’s Bramble.
*103362*
[[S:::3230-6690]]
Now take the shortcut back to the realm travel temple, then on to Helheim, yeah?
*103363*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl07_s010_010_brk:0-1670]]
I’ll be keeping my eye on you…
*103364*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl07_s020_010_mmr:120-2500]]
Now that Freya’s given you the travel rune to Helheim,
*103365*
[[S:::2900-4250]]
it should be unlocked on the table.
*103366*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl07_s020_020_mmr:77-873]]
Helheim.
*103367*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl07_s020_030_mmr:40-1072]]
And it’s done.
*103368*
[[S:::1500-2750]]
We really are doing this.
*103369*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl07_s030_010_brk:0-1500]]
I’ll be watching yer back!
*103370*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl07_s030_010_brk_a:0-1750]]
Promise… I’ll be watching yer back!
*103371*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl07_s040_010_mmr:60-3970]]
Let me take this moment to tell you that what you are about to do is absolutely insane.
*103372*
[[S:::4420-6740]]
Not even Odin can survive this cold,
*103373*
[[S:::7160-8600]]
so I hope those blades work.
*103374*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl08_s383_010_brk_stem:160-819]]
What—?
*103375*
[[S:::1000-3320]]
Hey! You reek of foreign magick.
*103376*
[[S:::4190-6065]]
Sweet Nanna’s nethers,
*103377*
[[S:::6230-7500]]
what are those…?
*103378*
[[S:::8940-10400]]
I have never seen the like…
*103379*
[[S:::10860-12815]]
That’s gotta be a family heirloom…
*103380*
[[S:::16790-17797]]
Son,
*103381*
[[S:::18120-21894]]
my brother and me created Mjölnir for the big idiot…
*103382*
[[S:::22070-23440]]
I know from quality.
*103383*
[[S:::24070-24770]]
And them…
*103384*
[[S:::25960-27040]]
them’s special.
*103385*
[[S:::29130-31220]]
Say, where’s the little turd?
*103386*
[[S:::35550-36440]]
No…
*103387*
[[S:::37130-37970]]
What happened?
*103388*
[[S:::38894-40209]]
Aesir?
*103389*
[[S:::51081-54794]]
We all gotta take responsibility sometime, huh?
*103390*
[[S:::55656-61386]]
Say, what can I do to help him? I can do things. You want I should tag along?
*103391*
[[S:::66977-67683]]
All right.
*103392*
[[S:::69989-72186]]
So where you off to in such a hurry?
*103393*
[[S:::74221-77151]]
Helheim?!? Shit… this is serious.
*103394*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl08_s383_010_kra_stem:12750-13494]]
NO.
*103395*
[[S:::14490-15836]]
Nor will it ever be.
*103396*
[[S:::33530-34837]]
He has fallen ill.
*103397*
[[S:::40180-40943]]
No.
*103398*
[[S:::41640-42839]]
The fault is mine…
*103399*
[[S:::44740-47002]]
and my responsibility to make it right.
*103400*
[[S:::61630-62325]]
No,
*103401*
[[S:::63150-64250]]
Your work here…
*103402*
[[S:::65600-66120]]
is enough.
*103403*
[[S:::72430-74027]]
The realm of the dead.
*103404*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl08_s010_010_brk:20-2750]]
You made it! Better get home to your boy already!
*103405*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl08_s020_010_mmr:97-3291]]
We shouldn’t delay, brother—it’s straight back to Midgard with that heart.
*103406*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl08_s030_010_mmr:140-2761]]
Your father was Zeus.
*103407*
[[S:::3388-5262]]
I finally understand.
*103408*
[[S:::5663-9679]]
I’m dangling from the hip of the bloody Ghost of Sparta.
*103409*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl08_s030_020_kra:60-1750]]
Do NOT call me that.
*103410*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl08_s030_030_mmr:116-3775]]
Don’t mistake me, brother. From what I heard, the pantheon had it coming.
*103411*
[[S:::4402-6250]]
But it’s still a bit to take in.
*103412*
[[S:::6878-10786]]
I knew you hate gods, but you really can’t stay away from them, can you?
*103413*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl08_s030_040_kra:190-1820]]
You must say nothing to the boy.
*103414*
[[S:::2250-3500]]
He must never know.
*103415*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl08_s030_050_mmr:150-3130]]
Bollocks, brother, respectfully, bollocks.
*103416*
[[S:::3630-7000]]
He has to know. He’ll never be whole without the truth.
*103417*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl08_s030_060_mmr:240-4836]]
Look, I get it. You hate the gods. All gods.
*103418*
[[S:::5140-6974]]
It’s no accident that includes yourself.
*103419*
[[S:::7440-9307]]
And it includes your boy,
*103420*
[[S:::9794-10498]]
don’t you see that?
*103421*
[[S:::10970-12174]]
He feels that!
*103422*
[[S:::12650-14325]]
He can’t help what he is.
*103423*
[[S:::14642-17858]]
He can’t begin to help it, because you haven’t even told him.
*103424*
[[S:::18276-20205]]
It’s all connected, man!
*103425*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl08_s030_070_kra:78-2483]]
You… will tell him nothing.
*103426*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl08_s030_080_mmr:0-598]]
Very well.
*103427*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl08_s040_010_brk:0-4470]]
Hey, so you know that shortcut between realms? Well, I made it better!
*103428*
[[S:::5080-6210]]
Or I might have brokes it.
*103429*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl08_s040_020_kra:40-1000]]
We use that…
*103430*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl08_s040_030_brk:80-890]]
I know you do!
*103431*
[[S:::1380-6000]]
So I took a few gusts from them Winds of Hel and made it so it ain’t just one-way.
*103432*
[[S:::6500-9000]]
Now you can use it to travel to and from.
*103433*
[[S:::9600-10500]]
If I didn’t breaks it.
*103434*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl08_s040_040_kra:0-1250]]
Then we can take it to Freya.
*103435*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl08_s040_050_mmr:90-1500]]
There’s an idea, brother!
*103436*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl08_s040_060_brk:53-3665]]
What’s the matter? Try out that shortcut ’tween realms!
*103437*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl08_s040_070_mmr:76-3372]]
We shouldn’t delay. The shortcut between realms, brother—use it.
*103438*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl08_s040_080_mmr:100-4735]]
This isn’t right, brother. We need the shortcut between realms—the one next to the dwarf’s shop.
*103439*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl08_s040_090_mmr:40-1750]]
Back to Freya’s. Quick as can be.
*103440*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl08_s040_100_brk:0-3120]]
Might be some kinks to sort out, but you’ll make it.
*103441*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl08_s040_110_mmr:0-1000]]
Just go, brother.
*103442*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel01_s387_010_kra_stem:43613-45315]]
I have the heart.
*103443*
[[S:::45538-46972]]
I need nothing more?
*103444*
[[S:::57652-58300]]
Zeus?
*103445*
[[S:::61184-61980]]
My father...
*103446*
[[S:::68621-70426]]
What is that place?
*103447*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel01_s387_010_mmr_stem:46972-48000]]
You’re set.
*103448*
[[S:::48246-50016]]
But better not to linger here though, eh?
*103449*
[[S:::58496-59586]]
Zeus?!?
*103450*
[[S:::62306-66538]]
Your father was Zeus?!? That explains a lot.
*103451*
[[S:::70151-74198]]
Never go there. Understand?
*103452*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel01_s387_010_zeu_stem:54124-55864]]
Kratos.
*103453*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel01_s388_010_brk_stem:1325-1971]]
Pssst.
*103454*
[[S:::2567-3303]]
Sshhh!
*103455*
[[S:::3754-5522]]
I ain’t supposed to be here.
*103456*
[[S:::6101-7111]]
S’cold!
*103457*
[[S:::7648-9400]]
Real quick, gimme your blades.
*103458*
[[S:::10206-12419]]
I said I’d help you and I aim to.
*103459*
[[S:::12654-13342]]
C’mon!
*103460*
[[S:::17403-19189]]
My equipment’s in Midgard.
*103461*
[[S:::19261-20186]]
Be right back.
*103462*
[[S:::24484-25283]]
There!
*103463*
[[S:::25912-27954]]
Now they’re ready for the Winds of Hel.
*103464*
[[S:::28468-31811]]
Just target this magical glowy bit here with your blades and throw.
*103465*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel01_s388_010_mmr_stem:1981-2435]]
Aah!
*103466*
[[S:::20952-21502]]
You...
*103467*
[[S:::22166-23961]]
you don’t suppose he nicked those, do you?
*103468*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel01_s388_010_kra_stem:9413-9957]]
Why?
*103469*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s010_010_kra:40-1500]]
Is this the bridge Freya spoke of?
*103470*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s010_020_mmr:80-4271]]
No, we’re still on the realm travel bridge. We’re after the Bridge of the Damned.
*103471*
[[S:::4271-7890]]
The dead use it to cross into their permanent home, the city of Helheim.
*103472*
[[S:::8480-11090]]
The bridge keeper who minds admission—he’s the one we want.
*103473*
[[S:::11570-14200]]
Just follow this bridge… should lead us straight to him.
*103474*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s010_030_mmr:0-3000]]
You know… I’d really hoped never to see this place again.
*103475*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s025_010_mmr:0-1200]]
Oh, this is all wrong.
*103476*
[[S:::1780-4260]]
Only the newly-dead should be here. There’s too many.
*103477*
[[S:::4910-9230]]
The gate must be closed… and if the gate’s closed, then it’s true— Hel’s full up.
*103478*
[[S:::9730-13350]]
Without the Valkyrie to sort and cull them, Hel is overwhelmed.
*103479*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s025_020_mmr:0-1500]]
Locked. Now what?
*103480*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s032_010_kra:0-2094]]
When we killed the reavers near my home…
*103481*
[[S:::2505-3524]]
they came here?
*103482*
[[S:::4743-6206]]
How did they return so quickly?
*103483*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s032_020_mmr:60-4676]]
Time doesn’t move the same between all realms, especially where the spirit world is concerned.
*103484*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s032_030_kra:40-1043]]
Like the light of Alfheim…
*103485*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s032_030_kra_a:40-1203]]
Like the light of Alfheim…
*103486*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s032_040_mmr:70-1080]]
The opposite, in fact…
*103487*
[[S:::1460-6340]]
the Lake of Souls feels faster than Alfheim time, but Hel is much slower than Midgard.
*103488*
[[S:::6810-8750]]
Sorry, I’m sure that’s confusing—
*103489*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s032_050_kra:180-3000]]
If we will be back to my son all the sooner, that is good.
*103490*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s032_060_mmr:20-350]]
Ah!
*103491*
[[S:::870-2000]]
Aren’t you a quick study.
*103492*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s034_010_kra:0-1390]]
This Valhalla…
*103493*
[[S:::1990-2950]]
is it within Hel?
*103494*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s034_020_mmr:40-830]]
Oh no, no—
*103495*
[[S:::1240-3180]]
Valhalla is part of Asgard.
*103496*
[[S:::3670-8050]]
Only the worthy dead go there, the warriors who die in glorious combat.
*103497*
[[S:::8530-10750]]
Hel is for those who die in dishonour.
*103498*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s034_030_kra:20-895]]
Criminals.
*103499*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s034_040_mmr:0-584]]
Aye,
*103500*
[[S:::984-3917]]
and those dead of disease, mishap, age…
*103501*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s034_050_kra:0-1670]]
It is dishonourable to grow old?
*103502*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s034_050_kra_a:40-1500]]
It is dishonourable to grow old?
*103503*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s034_060_mmr:40-530]]
Well,
*103504*
[[S:::940-3000]]
never too late to go out fighting, I suppose.
*103505*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s036_010_mmr:17-2482]]
That climb there could lead us out… if we could reach it.
*103506*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s038_010_kra:40-2750]]
Will killing the Bridge Keeper help the dead leave Midgard?
*103507*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s038_020_mmr:18-4254]]
I don’t expect it will. Though I don’t suppose it will make things any worse, either.
*103508*
[[S:::4659-8462]]
It’ll be one less obstacle for the living to reach the inner sanctum of Helheim…
*103509*
[[S:::9058-10790]]
but who’d be mad enough to go there?
*103510*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s040_010_mmr:60-1240]]
The Bridge of the Damned.
*103511*
[[S:::1720-5000]]
And there’s the keeper, making sure the dead are really dead.
*103512*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s040_011_kra:0-1000]]
What is that he holds?
*103513*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s040_020_mmr:100-5160]]
That totem contains a powerful source of magical energy—the very power of Helheim itself.
*103514*
[[S:::5600-7440]]
But what you want is his heart.
*103515*
[[S:::7920-9250]]
Just take it and we can leave.
*103516*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s040_030_kra:16-551]]
How?
*103517*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s040_040_mmr:160-2250]]
Start some trouble. You can do that, right?
*103518*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s040_050_mmr:0-1030]]
Now the heart, brother.
*103519*
[[S:::1700-3250]]
You’ll have to get your hands dirty.
*103520*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_hel01_s050_090_brk:30-2030]]
Right over here—that glowing bit.
*103521*
[[S:::2450-4750]]
Target ’er with your blades and give ’em a clean throw.
*103522*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_hel01_s050_100_brk:0-5060]]
Now target that wind trap with your blades—
*103523*
[[S:::5060-5840]]
it’s that little ball hanging in the middle of the door there, see it?
*103524*
[[S:::6460-7500]]
Just let ’er loose.
*103525*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_hel01_s050_110_brk:30-3237]]
Now target that wind trap with your blades. See there?
*103526*
[[S:::3237-5500]]
It’s a little ball hanging in the middle of the door.
*103527*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_hel01_s050_120_brk:60-630]]
See that?
*103528*
[[S:::1040-5418]]
Now you can absorb and release the Winds of Hel whenever it damn pleases you,
*103529*
[[S:::5418-7040]]
so you’re welcome and I’m leaving.
*103530*
[[S:::7040-9500]]
This place is cold enough to freeze a pair of pigeon eggs.
*103531*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s050_130_mmr:210-3250]]
I sometimes wonder if there was once some sort of accident in his brain.
*103532*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s050_140_kra:230-1250]]
We have been away too long.
*103533*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s060_010_mmr:0-2540]]
Sorry, brother… I’m still stuck on what I heard back there.
*103534*
[[S:::3240-4500]]
Zeus was your father?
*103535*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s060_020_kra:0-750]]
Not now.
*103536*
[[S:::1430-3450]]
We should focus on getting out of Hel.
*103537*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s060_030_mmr:0-1700]]
And with that I cannot argue.
*103538*
[[S:::2570-4750]]
I’ll just contemplate that little nugget in silence then.
*103539*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s015_010_mmr:0-3500]]
Use the fire of your blades to burn away that Hel’s Bramble blocking the path.
*103540*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s015_020_mmr:0-620]]
See that?
*103541*
[[S:::1000-3250]]
One of the many reasons we went back for those blades…
*103542*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel01_s045_010_kra:0-1100]]
How is he here?
*103543*
[[S:::1670-2750]]
That is not possible.
*103544*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s045_020_mmr:0-1490]]
It’s just an illusion.
*103545*
[[S:::1970-5080]]
Hel’s known for torturing its inhabitants with their own past.
*103546*
[[S:::5570-8000]]
We should focus on getting back to your son.
*103547*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel01_s045_030_mmr:0-2130]]
That lock needs a gust of Hel’s Wind to open it.
*103548*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel01_s070_010_son:8-2716]]
Here we go! I’m finally gonna get to see—
*103549*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel01_s070_020_son:16-7578]]
Why is it so cold?? I’m serious! This is unreasonable. I’ve seen enough—we can turn back now.
*103550*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel01_s070_030_son:2-1562]]
I can’t believe we’re back in Hel.
*103551*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel01_s070_040_mmr:10-3621]]
At least we’re not on the side of the bridge where those visions will torture us.
*103552*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel01_s070_050_son:0-1120]]
It’s so cold,
*103553*
[[S:::1670-3250]]
my spit freezes when I talk.
*103554*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel01_s070_060_son:5-240]]
Ptah!
*103555*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel01_s070_070_son:0-860]]
Okay! Great!
*103556*
[[S:::1490-5300]]
We’re done here? We can leave? We can go home now? And be warm?
*103557*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel01_s070_080_son:0-800]]
For the record,
*103558*
[[S:::1160-2800]]
I never need to come back here,
*103559*
[[S:::3160-3500]]
thanks.
*103563*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_riv65_s020_010_fre:90-2350]]
Those blades are clearly not from this realm…
*103564*
[[S:::3580-4630]]
they emanate heat
*103565*
[[S:::5280-6790]]
and terrible cruelty.
*103566*
[[S:::8110-10750]]
They will be effective against the Bridge Keeper,  but you should hurry.
*103567*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_riv65_s020_020_fre:60-2580]]
The longer you delay here, the more your son will suffer.
*103568*
[[S:::3080-5000]]
I can only keep him comfortable for so long.
*103569*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv07_s390_010_fre_stem:9270-10000]]
You have it?
*103570*
[[S:::20990-21840]]
Back of your hand.
*103571*
[[S:::32140-33380]]
I can break the fever,
*103572*
[[S:::34400-35370]]
but to heal…
*103573*
[[S:::39150-40140]]
Yes.
*103574*
[[S:::45140-45860]]
Help me prop him up?
*103575*
[[S:::55950-57760]]
Did I tell you that I have a son too?
*103576*
[[S:::59960-60590]]
It’s been...
*103577*
[[S:::62420-64400]]
forever since I last saw him.
*103578*
[[S:::65690-68440]]
At his birth, the runes foretold a needless death.
*103579*
[[S:::69890-71520]]
The babe in my arms was so
*103580*
[[S:::72470-73000]]
small,
*103581*
[[S:::74640-75840]]
so helpless.
*103582*
[[S:::77220-80880]]
I knew right then I would do anything to protect him.
*103583*
[[S:::82050-83720]]
No matter the sacrifice...
*103584*
[[S:::88900-91000]]
Of course everything I did, I did for myself.
*103585*
[[S:::92480-99080]]
I let my needs, my fears, come before what he needed...
*103586*
[[S:::100550-103370]]
and I couldn’t see his resentment until it was too late.
*103587*
[[S:::106480-110760]]
Don’t make the same mistake. Have faith in him.
*103588*
[[S:::111980-117200]]
I know the truth isn’t simple... but nothing is when it involves your child.
*103589*
[[S:::159490-160310]]
For now.
*103590*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv07_s390_010_kra_stem:8110-8760]]
The heart…
*103591*
[[S:::10280-10740]]
Yes.
*103592*
[[S:::27810-28880]]
He is still ill.
*103593*
[[S:::35480-37640]]
...he must know the truth of what he is.
*103594*
[[S:::41610-42850]]
It is not so simple.
*103595*
[[S:::124390-125530]]
It is a curse.
*103596*
[[S:::127560-129230]]
The boy has been cursed.
*103597*
[[S:::138850-139750]]
I will not.
*103598*
[[S:::153360-154370]]
I see that.
*103599*
[[S:::156080-157810]]
Is he well enough to travel?
*103600*
[[S:::168450-170390]]
You see that it does not.
*103601*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv07_s390_010_son_stem:137237-138327]]
Don’t leave without me.
*103602*
[[S:::150913-152001]]
I’m better now.
*103603*
[[S:::163320-164340]]
It won’t happen again.
*103604*
[[S:::167040-168150]]
I promise.
*103605*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv07_s400_010_kra_stem:5600-6480]]
You are quiet.
*103606*
[[S:::7860-8870]]
Are you not better?
*103607*
[[S:::13630-15640]]
I know you overheard my talk with Freya.
*103608*
[[S:::16740-18590]]
You think you understand. But you do not.
*103609*
[[S:::23430-24480]]
Why do you say nothing?
*103610*
[[S:::46810-48260]]
You do not know everything, boy.
*103611*
[[S:::55650-56090]]
The truth…
*103612*
[[S:::59950-60370]]
The truth.
*103613*
[[S:::64570-65650]]
I am a god, boy,
*103614*
[[S:::67315-69371]]
from another land, far from here.
*103615*
[[S:::73020-78354]]
When I came to these shores, I chose to live as a man. But the truth is…
*103616*
[[S:::79605-82997]]
I was born a god. And so were you.
*103617*
[[S:::88069-88926]]
Boy?
*103618*
[[S:::90374-91975]]
Have you nothing to say?
*103619*
[[S:::102143-106359]]
Can you turn into an animal?
*103620*
[[S:::109035-114483]]
No… no, I do not think so.
*103621*
[[S:::123538-127615]]
No, she was mortal, but she knew my true nature.
*103622*
[[S:::140208-142532]]
I had hoped to spare you.
*103623*
[[S:::143876-150197]]
Being a god… it can be lifetime of anguish and tragedy.
*103624*
[[S:::151732-153306]]
That is the curse.
*103625*
[[S:::169927-178197]]
I do not know the reach of your godhood, but over time, we will learn.
*103626*
[[S::vo_lvl_riv07_s400_010_son_stem:11230-12020]]
I guess.
*103627*
[[S:::27250-28480]]
You said I was cursed.
*103628*
[[S:::30612-32832]]
You think I’m weak, because I’m not like you.
*103629*
[[S:::34158-36474]]
I know I was never what you wanted.
*103630*
[[S:::37147-40362]]
But after all this, I thought…
*103631*
[[S:::42133-44052]]
maybe things were different.
*103632*
[[S:::50441-51461]]
No.
*103633*
[[S:::52634-54843]]
But at least I know the truth now.
*103634*
[[S:::94475-98242]]
I’m… Can I…
*103635*
[[S:::99491-101236]]
turn into an animal?
*103636*
[[S:::117447-119036]]
I’m a god.
*103637*
[[S:::120308-123682]]
Mother knew? She was a god too?
*103638*
[[S:::129167-130845]]
I’m a god.
*103639*
[[S:::132196-134212]]
Why did you wait so long to tell me?
*103640*
[[S:::157395-163573]]
What sorts of things can I do? Can I fly? Or turn invisible?
*103641*
[[S:::164613-167985]]
I don’t feel like a god.
*103642*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv07_s010_010_mmr:10-1301]]
Well, this isn’t right.
*103643*
[[S:::1922-2737]]
But close enough.
*103644*
[[S:::3012-4210]]
He did say there were kinks.
*103645*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv07_s010_020_kra:0-750]]
We must hurry.
*103646*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv07_s020_005_kra:70-620]]
Freya…
*103647*
[[S:::1210-2750]]
I will not forget this.
*103648*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv07_s020_010_son:17-521]]
Thanks…
*103649*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_riv07_s020_020_fre:0-3500]]
Your father did the heavy lifting. You should stay. Recover.
*103650*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv07_s020_030_kra:49-1118]]
You have done enough.
*103651*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_riv07_s020_040_fre:30-2000]]
You know my door is always open to you.
*103652*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv07_s020_050_son:50-640]]
Sorry.
*103653*
[[S:::1090-2000]]
Guess we’re going…
*103654*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv07_s030_010_son:60-1620]]
That’s Vanaheim, isn’t it?
*103655*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_riv07_s030_020_fre:40-1500]]
You figured that out, did you?
*103656*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv07_s030_030_son:0-2132]]
Well, the window looks like Bifröst crystal…
*103657*
[[S:::2426-4458]]
and I know that’s not what’s on the other side of the wall.
*103658*
[[S:::4946-6232]]
And, well…
*103659*
[[S:::6998-7900]]
it makes you sad.
*103660*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_riv07_s030_040_fre:50-1750]]
You are wise for one so young.
*103661*
[[S:::2330-5330]]
Yes, this is a window to a home I left long ago.
*103662*
[[S:::6030-7000]]
But it’s only a view.
*103663*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv07_s030_050_son:90-1720]]
The thing that happened to you in Alfheim…
*103664*
[[S:::2500-4530]]
you can’t leave Midgard, can you?
*103665*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_riv07_s030_060_fre:40-3500]]
A “gift” from my former husband upon our separation.
*103666*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv07_s030_070_son:70-1500]]
Why would Odin trap you in Midgard?
*103667*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_riv07_s030_080_fre:60-2470]]
Petty cruelty would be reason enough for him.
*103668*
[[S:::3290-6850]]
But as with all his rash decisions, he’s driven by fear.
*103669*
[[S:::7630-12160]]
The Vanir were the greatest threat to the Aesir until our marriage brokered peace.
*103670*
[[S:::12690-15291]]
Many of the Vanir now think I betrayed them…
*103671*
[[S:::15750-17290]]
the fruits of my sacrifice—
*103672*
[[S:::18220-19960]]
to be hated by my own kind.
*103673*
[[S:::20810-22050]]
To trap me here
*103674*
[[S:::22460-24250]]
is to ensure I can never make it right.
*103675*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv07_s040_010_mmr:140-5500]]
Now then… before Modi so rudely interrupted us, we were just about to explore Týr’s vault.
*103676*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv07_s040_020_kra:150-2060]]
Yes. To find the Black Rune.
*103677*
[[S:::2790-4750]]
Boy, do you know the way from here?
*103678*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv07_s040_030_son:0-1000]]
Oh. I don’t know.
*103679*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv07_s040_040_mmr:30-2400]]
Sure, you do, lad. We need a boat!
*103680*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv07_s040_050_son:0-570]]
I dunno,
*103681*
[[S:::990-1950]]
I guess we need a boat.
*103682*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv07_s040_060_mmr:62-1673]]
Okay then!
*103683*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv07_s050_020_mmr:0-1250]]
Nope! Still kinked!
*103684*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_riv07_s060_010_mmr:30-790]]
Ah, see?
*103685*
[[S:::1250-2310]]
The boat washed ashore.
*103686*
[[S:::2940-4750]]
Someone did call the serpent earlier.
*103687*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv07_s060_020_kra:40-480]]
Get in.
*103688*
[[S:::990-1500]]
I will pull.
*103689*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv07_s070_010_son:0-1500]]
You sure I can’t turn into a wolf?
*103690*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_riv07_s070_020_kra:90-2000]]
You are welcome to surprise me…
*103691*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv07_s015_010_mmr:15-1557]]
Ought’n we be gettin’ back to Freya’s?
*103692*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s267_010_son_stem:3858-10675]]
I think I see how this works… the Claw’s on one side, and if we get this unstuck—
*103693*
[[S:::20000-23500]]
Oh no… I think the rope’s stuck under that rock.
*103694*
[[S:::25043-28302]]
Yes sir. Sorry, sir.
*103695*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s267_010_kra_stem:11240-11730]]
BOY!
*103696*
[[S:::23900-27000]]
That was careless.
*103697*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s270_010_son_stem:2225-4126]]
Wait! That one’s not broken!
*103698*
[[S:::6537-10014]]
There’s a note… a Giant’s prayer.
*103699*
[[S:::10944-15259]]
They’re asking their ancestors to watch over them… to guide them home.
*103700*
[[S:::18089-22161]]
Wait! I think I know how it works…
*103701*
[[S:::34911-35753]]
Watch.
*103702*
[[S:::42700-44413]]
Wow…
*103703*
[[S:::55820-57597]]
I asked them to watch over mother.
*103704*
[[S:::61523-63948]]
Do you think they’ll watch over us on our way to the top?
*103705*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s270_010_kra_stem:16850-17950]]
Boy—
*103706*
[[S:::53030-54080]]
What did you write?
*103707*
[[S:::67920-70902]]
Come, boy. It is a long way up.
*103708*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s280_010_kra_stem:4520-5130]]
Wait, boy.
*103709*
[[S:::12290-13650]]
If we can catch it off balance.
*103710*
[[S:::18520-19420]]
What are you doing?
*103711*
[[S:::29830-30800]]
You break right.
*103712*
[[S:::31520-32470]]
Find an angle.
*103713*
[[S:::33010-34000]]
Wait for my mark.
*103714*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s280_010_son_stem:7330-8010]]
It’s Sindri!
*103715*
[[S:::9790-11090]]
Can you kill something that big?
*103716*
[[S:::14510-15460]]
I can distract him.
*103717*
[[S:::24620-25630]]
We have to help him.
*103718*
[[S:::35860-36250]]
Thank you.
*103727*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s290_010_son_stem:2250-4606]]
Wow. We actually did it!
*103728*
[[S:::6785-7681]]
And you—
*103729*
[[S:::31673-32688]]
What are these?
*103730*
[[S:::37010-37594]]
Oh.
*103731*
[[S:::38778-39404]]
Thanks?
*103732*
[[S:::48137-50302]]
Yeah! He said you lost your talent.
*103733*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s290_010_sin_stem:7730-8519]]
Ahhh…
*103734*
[[S:::8870-12516]]
But—but—but—nobody’s killed a dragon for hundreds of years…
*103735*
[[S:::12591-14485]]
not since the Grand Culling of the Wyrms!
*103736*
[[S:::14500-16512]]
And unless I’m mistaken, you did all that…
*103737*
[[S:::16800-17670]]
for me!
*103738*
[[S:::23590-26577]]
You deny it all you want, but you saved me. And that…
*103739*
[[S:::26577-28455]]
… deserves compensation.
*103740*
[[S:::32840-36572]]
Braided mistletoe arrows. Straighter than Heimdall and perfectly weighted.
*103741*
[[S:::39720-40600]]
Oh,
*103742*
[[S:::40810-41560]]
okay…
*103743*
[[S:::41760-42590]]
Hold on…
*103744*
[[S:::42720-43200]]
uh…
*103745*
[[S:::43320-44160]]
Ew, not that.
*103746*
[[S:::44520-45288]]
Um…
*103747*
[[S:::45930-47090]]
You see my brother again?
*103748*
[[S:::51380-54033]]
Oh, and that I’m selfish (no), I’m sure.
*103749*
[[S:::54033-56957]]
That I value a weapon’s look (no) over its purpose.
*103750*
[[S:::56957-59420]]
That I’m pretentious (no!) and uptight.
*103751*
[[S:::59420-60345]]
Fussy.
*103752*
[[S:::60350-61505]]
I know what he thinks.
*103753*
[[S:::61505-62563]]
But he can’t hurt me any—
*103754*
[[S:::62563-63641]]
AH!!
*103755*
[[S:::64910-65876]]
Burn that.
*103756*
[[S:::69593-72802]]
No! No-no-no, wait-wait-wait-wait…
*103757*
[[S:::74122-75600]]
I have a better idea.
*103758*
[[S:::76900-78717]]
I just need a tooth from that dragon.
*103759*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s290_010_kra_stem:18460-19450]]
You are mistaken.
*103760*
[[S:::20020-21970]]
The dragon was simply in our path… nothing more.
*103761*
[[S:::67380-69250]]
I do not have time for this.
*103762*
[[S:::75670-76309]]
What?
*103763*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s295_010_sin_stem:1940-3140]]
Yeeeah…
*103764*
[[S:::3660-5120]]
I’m not touching that.
*103765*
[[S:::5610-6310]]
Just hold it out.
*103766*
[[S:::14460-17310]]
Now run that along the string of your son’s bow.
*103767*
[[S:::19660-20610]]
Just humour me.
*103768*
[[S:::31550-32600]]
Two passes should do it.
*103769*
[[S:::35540-36570]]
Gently, now!
*103770*
[[S:::42130-43750]]
Oh sure, now you’re impressed.
*103771*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s295_010_kra_stem:24890-25582]]
Atreus…
*103772*
[[S:::25920-26692]]
your bow.
*103773*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s295_010_son_stem:40828-41433]]
Whoa.
*103774*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s300_010_kra_stem:10760-12500]]
A broken quiver will slow your draw.
*103775*
[[S:::13810-14760]]
Pain we endure,
*103776*
[[S:::15420-16990]]
faulty weaponry we do not.
*103777*
[[S:::19220-19920]]
This will do for now.
*103778*
[[S:::21320-23000]]
Good?
*103779*
[[S:::28340-29100]]
Go.
*103780*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s300_010_son_stem:26572-26785]]
Good.
*103781*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s310_010_mmr_stem:3660-9970]]
Ahhh… the very topic of conversation… a tattooed man travelling with a child.
*103782*
[[S:::18400-20123]]
He doesn’t know what you are…
*103783*
[[S:::24590-31260]]
Me? I’m the greatest ambassador to the gods, the Giants, and all the creatures of the Nine Realms.
*103784*
[[S:::31260-35970]]
I know every corner of these lands, every language spoken, every war waged, every deal struck.
*103785*
[[S:::35970-43440]]
They call me… Mimir! —smartest man alive, and I have the answer to your every question.
*103786*
[[S:::48250-51040]]
Okay, there are a few gaps in my knowledge.
*103787*
[[S:::51090-56110]]
But Odin’s had me imprisoned here for… 109 winters.
*103788*
[[S:::56950-62700]]
I’m a clever lad, I can piece it together, I promise. Just… given time. 
*103789*
[[S:::74400-77220]]
Oh, then you’ve come to the wrong place, little brother.
*103790*
[[S:::77220-80300]]
The highest peak in all the realms is not here in Midgard.
*103791*
[[S:::80300-83500]]
It’s in Jötunheim, realm of the Giants.
*103792*
[[S:::89060-90270]]
Take a look…
*103793*
[[S:::95110-98650]]
This is the last known bridge to Jötunheim in all the realms.
*103794*
[[S:::98800-102100]]
See that mountain, looks like a Giant’s fingers scraping the sky?
*103795*
[[S:::102100-106120]]
That’s the highest peak in all the realms… Not here.
*103796*
[[S:::109340-112000]]
When the Giants destroyed all other bridges to their realm,
*103797*
[[S:::112000-114500]]
they locked this one up with a secret rune.
*103798*
[[S:::114500-116881]]
If it still exists, only a Giant would know it.
*103799*
[[S:::119301-125560]]
True. But today the winds of fate have kicked up a strange vortex of coincidence.
*103800*
[[S:::125560-130540]]
Fact is, there’s only one person alive who can get you where you need to go…
*103801*
[[S:::130540-134850]]
and luckily for you, my schedule’s wide open.
*103802*
[[S:::143020-146210]]
It’s your best and only move from a tactical standpoint.
*103803*
[[S:::146400-150260]]
It’s the one place the man who cannot be killed won’t follow you.
*103804*
[[S:::154784-156267]]
First, you need to cut off my head.
*103805*
[[S:::157547-162420]]
Odin made sure that no weapon, not even Thor’s hammer, could free my body from these bonds.
*103806*
[[S:::162420-164740]]
But fortunately, you don’t need my body.
*103807*
[[S:::164740-169730]]
The trick is, we need to find someone who can reanimate my head, using the old magic.
*103808*
[[S:::174421-176234]]
And she’ll help? She might do. Worth a try!
*103809*
[[S:::180000-183900]]
He tortures me, you know. Every day, brother.
*103810*
[[S:::184200-191500]]
Odin himself sees to it personally, and believe me, there is no end to his creativity.
*103811*
[[S:::192100-200420]]
Every. Single. Day. This… this isn’t living.
*103812*
[[S:::210530-215400]]
Brother, in case you can’t resurrect me, there’s something you need know.
*103813*
[[S:::216500-217890]]
The boy……
*103814*
[[S:::217890-221100]]
the longer you wait to tell him his true nature, the more damage you do.
*103815*
[[S:::221100-224460]]
He will resent you, and you may lose him forever.
*103816*
[[S:::227603-232230]]
Aye… so you value your privacy more than your son?
*103817*
[[S:::235640-236900]]
Fair enough.
*103818*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s310_010_kra_stem:11170-13350]]
Boy, check their path and make sure we are alone.
*103819*
[[S:::14620-15820]]
Do as I say.
*103820*
[[S:::20760-22030]]
And I would keep it that way.
*103821*
[[S:::23460-24540]]
Who are you?
*103822*
[[S:::43990-45820]]
Why does the son of Odin hunt us?
*103823*
[[S:::67590-68880]]
The boy’s mother is dead.
*103824*
[[S:::69550-70110]]
She wished her—
*103825*
[[S:::85830-87602]]
That could not be what she meant...
*103826*
[[S:::152500-153656]]
What do we do?
*103827*
[[S:::169975-174421]]
Old magic… there is a witch of the woods, she knows the old ways.
*103828*
[[S:::176234-178475]]
But if she fails, you will be dead.
*103829*
[[S:::203862-205118]]
Very well.
*103830*
[[S:::224479-227603]]
There is much about me I would not have him know.
*103831*
[[S:::233000-235518]]
I’m going to cut off your head now.
*103832*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp01_s310_010_son_stem:13393-14615]]
But… we just saw them leave.
*103833*
[[S:::63466-66469]]
Nobody there…just like I said.
*103834*
[[S:::70115-74341]]
She wanted us to spread her ashes on the highest peaks of all the realms.
*103835*
[[S:::83414-84800]]
No!
*103836*
[[S:::106211-109948]]
Can’t we just take that bridge? We have a Bifröst.
*103837*
[[S:::116881-119301]]
And all of them left Midgard a long time ago…
*103838*
[[S:::141234-143020]]
We’re going to Jötunheim, right?
*103839*
[[S:::153676-154784]]
Yes!
*103840*
[[S:::156267-157547]]
Wait, what?
*103841*
[[S:::205118-207083]]
I can’t watch this.
*103842*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s001_010_son:38-1039]]
The mouth…
*103843*
[[S:::1039-1084]]
we made it.
*103844*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s001_020_kra:80-1000]]
More Black Breath.
*103845*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s002_010_son:20-2130]]
Where are we going?  The entrance was back there.
*103846*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s002_020_kra:78-1014]]
Are you in a hurry?
*103847*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s002_030_son:140-3500]]
No! But you normally are. I’m happy to keep exploring.
*103848*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s003_010_son:39-1930]]
You want to leave already? We just got here.
*103849*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s005_010_son:150-4867]]
That emblem—it matches the one on the door to Jötunheim in Týr’s temple.  The Giants did come here!
*103850*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s010_010_son:90-1600]]
Is that… a deer?
*103851*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s010_020_son:1615-3612]]
I don’t remember stories of a giant with a deer head. Wonder who he is?
*103852*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_010_son:0-2220]]
No way across, but there’s a sand bowl.
*103853*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_011_son:76-1093]]
Maybe the riddle will help?
*103854*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_012_kra:80-894]]
What does it say?
*103855*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_013_son:50-1020]]
“No yoked beast,
*103856*
[[S:::1390-3920]]
nor fearful thrall / Nor rooted tree
*103857*
[[S:::4370-5500]]
doth know my call.”
*103858*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_014_kra:86-679]]
Hm.
*103859*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_020_kra:43-682]]
Nothing.
*103860*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_030_kra:75-885]]
The floor, boy.
*103861*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_040_son:62-2442]]
That doesn’t mean anything. Something’s missing.
*103862*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_050_son:80-1868]]
Think there’s a second light crystal around here?
*103863*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_060_kra:0-500]]
Seek it out.
*103864*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_070_son:0-1220]]
I’ve looked all over this room.
*103865*
[[S:::1660-2990]]
Don’t see the other crystal anywhere…
*103866*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_080_son:50-450]]
Oh!
*103867*
[[S:::800-2000]]
How do you think that got up there?
*103868*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_090_son:91-3672]]
This place must have been important to the giants. It’s like they’re testing us.
*103869*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_100_son:29-1517]]
Okay, that looks right.
*103870*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_110_son:60-900]]
Still no help.
*103871*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_120_son:0-1250]]
I can almost make it out…
*103872*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_130_kra:71-989]]
What is the riddle?
*103873*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s030_140_son:190-3080]]
“No yoked beast,nor fearful thrall /
*103874*
[[S:::3620-6260]]
Nor rooted tree doth know my call.”
*103875*
[[S:::7290-8200]]
Not sure what a
*103876*
[[S:::8620-9530]]
“thrall” is, but
*103877*
[[S:::9910-10750]]
“freedom” fits the rest.
*103878*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s032_010_son:60-3000]]
Why are we leaving? Pretty sure the way up the mountain is inside.
*103879*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s035_010_son:39-3477]]
Is that… sap? In a cave?
*103880*
[[S:::3477-3587]]
Weird.
*103881*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s040_010_son:49-1758]]
Runes! I can read it now!
*103882*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s040_020_kra:122-978]]
Is it the answer?
*103883*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s040_030_son:140-630]]
“Freedom” …
*103884*
[[S:::1190-2000]]
sure, that works!
*103885*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s040_040_kra:60-890]]
The runes.
*103886*
[[S:::1420-3000]]
The riddle answer for that sand bowl?
*103887*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s040_050_son:60-990]]
It means “freedom.”
*103888*
[[S:::1490-2050]]
Let’s try it!
*103889*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s040_060_kra:140-750]]
Go ahead.
*103890*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s040_070_son:0-392]]
Sure.
*103891*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s040_080_son:54-785]]
Frelsa
*103892*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s050_010_son:62-697]]
What’s it doing?
*103893*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s050_020_son:0-1897]]
Oh! Thought maybe there’d be a bridge.
*103894*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s050_030_kra:67-3021]]
Rrrn. Your Giants mean to test us further.
*103895*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s055_010_son:87-2549]]
There’s a crystal in that torch holder. Should I light it?
*103896*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s055_020_son:40-750]]
That helps, right?
*103897*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s060_010_son:0-1440]]
Guess we have to down to go up?
*103898*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s070_010_kra:110-2650]]
These passages seem too small for Giants.
*103899*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s070_020_son:59-628]]
(giggles)
*103900*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s070_030_kra:0-750]]
Why do you laugh?
*103901*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s070_040_son:40-1500]]
Oh… you’re serious.
*103902*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s070_050_kra:70-1590]]
I am always serious.
*103903*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s070_060_son:0-580]]
I forget…
*103904*
[[S:::1100-3430]]
Mom always said you never took an interest in history.
*103905*
[[S:::3940-6700]]
Giants are just a race, like Elves and Huldrafolk.
*103906*
[[S:::7341-8492]]
It doesn’t mean they’re big.
*103907*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s070_070_kra:60-1250]]
What of the World Serpent?
*103908*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s070_080_son:0-2450]]
Okay, in that case, giant also means big.
*103909*
[[S:::2820-3940]]
But there’s only one of him.
*103910*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s080_010_kra:40-540]]
Boy…
*103911*
[[S:::940-1750]]
another light crystal.
*103912*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s085_010_son:90-1540]]
Just look at this place.
*103913*
[[S:::1900-3000]]
It feels so—
*103914*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s085_020_kra:104-760]]
Dead.
*103915*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s085_030_son:60-1630]]
I was gonna say “ancient,”
*103916*
[[S:::2020-2250]]
but
*103917*
[[S:::2980-3750]]
dead works too.
*103918*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s090_010_son:107-1340]]
How’d you know that was there?
*103919*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s109_010_son:430-2250]]
Uhh… this is a lot of bodies.
*103920*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s110_010_kra:80-1000]]
Tell me what you see.
*103921*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s110_020_son:0-2620]]
Well… they look like men, not Giants.
*103922*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s110_030_kra:80-570]]
Correct.
*103923*
[[S:::920-1970]]
Thieves seeking treasure.
*103924*
[[S:::2340-3000]]
See the traps?
*103925*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s110_040_son:90-2430]]
Oh yeah. Lucky for us they set ’em all off.
*103926*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s110_050_kra:110-1750]]
Be grateful these stay dead.
*103927*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s120_010_son:90-2053]]
The statue! We made it across!
*103928*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s120_020_son:79-1585]]
Guess we’re not going back that way.
*103929*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s130_010_son:60-410]]
Ohhh…
*103930*
[[S:::960-2010]]
this is Duraþrór,
*103931*
[[S:::2500-4430]]
one of the four stags of the World Tree.
*103932*
[[S:::5180-8250]]
He’s supposed to watch the entrance to Jötunheim while the giants sleep.
*103933*
[[S:::8250-10081]]
Think he’s still there?
*103934*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s130_020_kra:80-750]]
I do not know.
*103935*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s140_010_son:24-678]]
Where to now?
*103936*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s140_020_kra:70-1550]]
The peak is still our goal…
*103937*
[[S:::2080-3000]]
we find a way up.
*103938*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s145_010_son:30-1750]]
Nothing down here but some  weird sap.
*103939*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s145_020_son:44-3617]]
It’s that weird sap again. I think we’re on the other side.
*103940*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s147_010_son:60-640]]
Wow.
*103941*
[[S:::1630-3160]]
“The highest peak in the realms.”
*103942*
[[S:::3680-5390]]
Think Mom knew this was the Giant’s mountain?
*103943*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s147_020_kra:100-4710]]
No. Her request has been more… complicated, than she could have foreseen.
*103944*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s148_010_kra:104-996]]
Those runes…
*103945*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s148_020_son:90-1100]]
It’s a name, I think—
*103946*
[[S:::1670-2550]]
Hræzlyr.
*103947*
[[S:::3110-4000]]
It means “terror”.
*103948*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s150_010_son:55-3749]]
Hey, who do you think lit these torches? The dead don’t need light.
*103949*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s150_020_kra:110-750]]
Eyes open.
*103950*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s155_010_son:59-1139]]
HELLOOOO!
*103951*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s155_020_kra:0-600]]
Stop that.
*103952*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s155_030_son:46-1308]]
C’mon, I was just—
*103953*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s155_040_son:34-563]]
Okay…
*103954*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s160_010_son:30-630]]
Whoa…
*103955*
[[S:::1260-2380]]
what is all this?
*103956*
[[S:::3000-3750]]
Where are we?
*103957*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s160_020_kra:150-700]]
A mine…
*103958*
[[S:::1360-3060]]
and if this claw reaches the summit,
*103959*
[[S:::3470-4650]]
our goal is near.
*103960*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s160_030_son:40-1420]]
Alright. How do we use it?
*103961*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s163_010_son:0-2000]]
There’s gotta be a way to make that claw work.
*103962*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s163_020_son:0-2550]]
There’s a machine with gears and rope by that torch.
*103963*
[[S:::2700-4070]]
What do you think that’s for?
*103964*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s167_010_son:100-1250]]
Well that’s not going anywhere.
*103965*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s175_010_son:182-2621]]
We don’t have to leave. I’m sure we can figure this out.
*103966*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s180_010_son:49-749]]
It’s stuck.
*103967*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s180_020_son:80-2030]]
But maybe we can find a way up through there!
*103968*
[[S:::2530-3260]]
After… you know…
*103969*
[[S:::3760-4750]]
getting rid of those things.
*103970*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s180_021_son:52-4251]]
But maybe we can find a way up through there!… Uhhh… after getting rid of that!
*103971*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s180_030_son:30-2900]]
I don’t think that’s a good idea. You might snap the rope.
*103972*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s180_040_son:80-2000]]
Maybe we should find a way up to it instead?
*103973*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s190_010_son:54-2017]]
Looks like something’s supposed to roll on these.
*103974*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s200_010_son:56-841]]
See anything?
*103975*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s200_020_kra:60-750]]
Mining cart.
*103976*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s200_030_son:121-1097]]
That could be useful, yeah?
*103977*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s210_020_kra:40-3500]]
We need to free the rope from under the mess you created up there, boy.
*103978*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s210_030_son:30-1460]]
I get it. I screwed up.
*103979*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s210_040_son:0-1750]]
Maybe if you pull on the crank really hard, it’ll come free?
*103980*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s210_050_son:0-2500]]
Maybe there’s a way up there through the passage that opened?
*103981*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s210_060_kra:60-800]]
We will see.
*103982*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s220_010_son:220-2500]]
The machinery in here looks almost Dwarven,
*103983*
[[S:::2700-5000]]
but the stonework… that’s definitely Jötun.
*103984*
[[S:::5200-9400]]
You know, I think the Giants not only mined the mountain, but actually lived here.
*103985*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s230_010_son:43-547]]
What’s that?
*103986*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s230_020_son:50-5020]]
Weird. There’s a candle all tangled up with string and some sort of animal hide.
*103987*
[[S:::5020-5500]]
Some kind of lantern?
*103988*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s230_030_son:0-750]]
No wick though.
*103989*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s230_040_kra:270-3000]]
That is of no use to us. The Bifröst lights our way.
*103990*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s232_010_son:90-2500]]
Wow. How big is this place?
*103991*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s232_020_kra:90-1090]]
It is a mountain.
*103992*
[[S:::2030-2250]]
Big.
*103993*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s235_010_kra:0-750]]
More traps.
*103994*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s235_020_son:130-2250]]
There’s a tunnel, but you won’t fit.
*103995*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s235_030_kra:44-546]]
Take it.
*103996*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s235_040_son:50-350]]
Okay—
*103997*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s238_010_son:20-500]]
You okay?
*103998*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s238_010_son_a:70-500]]
You okay?
*103999*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s238_020_kra:90-750]]
Of course.
*104000*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s240_010_son:41-776]]
What happened to him?
*104001*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s240_020_kra:82-780]]
It died.
*104002*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s240_030_son:0-1000]]
Well. Yeah…
*104003*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s240_040_son:82-2472]]
Think you can move it? Looks kind of heavy.
*104004*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s240_050_kra:70-1250]]
I can move it.
*104005*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s240_060_son:45-755]]
It moves!
*104006*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s240_070_son:150-1220]]
Aaand we’re stuck.
*104007*
[[S:::1810-2500]]
Cart’s still attached to the—
*104008*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s240_080_kra:47-749]]
I see that.
*104009*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s240_090_kra:60-300]]
There.
*104010*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s240_100_son:38-532]]
Let’s go!
*104011*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s250_010_son:40-1300]]
It’s the main room,
*104012*
[[S:::1740-2750]]
but how do we get through that?
*104013*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s250_020_kra:0-1750]]
Look for the draw chain that opens it.
*104014*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s260_010_son:93-1824]]
Maybe there’s a way through the big gate up there?
*104015*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s265_010_son:29-1267]]
That’s it! Come on up.
*104016*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s265_010_son_a:29-583]]
That’s it!
*104017*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s265_020_son:0-750]]
No way up from here…
*104018*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s270_010_son:82-742]]
It’s working!
*104019*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s270_010_son_a:110-784]]
It’s working!
*104020*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s275_010_son:81-1386]]
Look at all this old stuff.
*104021*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s275_020_kra:120-2472]]
If it is not useful, leave it alone.
*104022*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s275_030_son:24-368]]
I know.
*104023*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s280_010_son:112-2284]]
Okay! I think we can get to that rock now.
*104024*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s280_010_son_a:30-2150]]
Okay! I think we can get to that rock now.
*104025*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s280_020_son:116-3356]]
Still need to free the rope. Think you can use the cart to get us up there?
*104026*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s280_020_son_a:87-3439]]
Still need to free the rope. Think you can use the cart to get us up there?
*104027*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s280_030_son:110-1028]]
I think it’s up ahead.
*104028*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s290_010_son:68-1563]]
Look! Another lantern!
*104029*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s290_020_kra:60-710]]
Broken.
*104030*
[[S:::1100-1750]]
Leave it.
*104031*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s290_030_son:138-4554]]
What could they be for? There’s something special about them. I can feel it.
*104032*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s299_010_son:52-1080]]
Well, that looks heavy.
*104033*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s299_020_son:0-500]]
No way.
*104034*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s299_030_son:0-450]]
How—?!
*104035*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s299_040_son:12-4005]]
You did it! I bet we can make the rope wheel work now. Might give us a way to the top!
*104036*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s299_050_son:73-3123]]
The rope’s still pinned under the rock. Don’t we need to move it first?
*104037*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s300_010_kra:7-629]]
Your quiver.
*104038*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s300_020_son:0-1867]]
Strap broke when we fought the dragon.
*104039*
[[S:::2429-2950]]
It’s all right—
*104040*
[[S:::3360-3910]]
I can hold it.
*104041*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s300_030_kra:12-370]]
Stop.
*104042*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_014_son:40-1470]]
You hear those voices too, right?
*104043*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_015_kra:40-1500]]
Yes. Be silent…
*104044*
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_020_bld:40-4000]]
You know why we’re here. My last visit manage to loosen your tongue? 
*104045*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_030_son:83-3375]]
That sounds like the same man who came to our house. You said you killed him…
*104046*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_040_kra:36-359]]
Sshhh.
*104047*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_050_mmr:130-1520]]
I see you brought company this time.
*104048*
[[S:::2490-6850]]
Must be important if the sons of Thor deign to grace me with their presence.
*104049*
[[S:::7400-8080]]
Tell me…
*104050*
[[S:::8450-11250]]
you two still tripping over yourselves to impress daddy?
*104051*
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_060_bld:20-3700]]
The tattooed man. Tracks show he now travels with a child.
*104052*
[[S:::4050-5250]]
Where would they go next?
*104053*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_070_mmr:340-1750]]
Why would I know that?
*104054*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_080_mgi:0-2380]]
You’re the smartest man alive, aren’t you?
*104055*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_090_mmr:50-2000]]
Smarter than all the dead ones, too.
*104056*
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_100_bld:0-3940]]
You help me, I help you.
*104057*
[[S:::4300-5500]]
Tell me where they are and I’ll talk to Odin—
*104058*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_110_mmr:36-5165]]
Your father won’t let me go, Baldur, and he won’t let you kill me. You have nothing to offer me.
*104059*
[[S:::5165-11871]]
So take your questions, take your threats, take these two worthless wankers, and piss off.
*104060*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_120_mdi:30-780]]
When no one’s looking…
*104061*
[[S:::1590-2750]]
we’ll be back for your other eye.
*104062*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_130_mgi:0-1150]]
Don’t you forget…
*104063*
[[S:::1690-2500]]
we’re everywhere.
*104064*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_140_mdi:70-750]]
We really are, aren’t we?
*104065*
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_pkp01_s305_150_bld:330-2610]]
Shut up, you idiots.
*104066*
[[S:::3310-4000]]
Let’s go.
*104067*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s310_010_kra:0-1000]]
Back to the wheel.
*104068*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s320_010_son:10-800]]
It’s working!
*104069*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s320_020_son:24-977]]
We got the claw back!
*104070*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s320_030_son:160-1250]]
Oop—there it goes again…
*104071*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s320_040_son:46-3362]]
If we could just ride up with the claw somehow, we’d be to the top in no time…
*104072*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s320_050_son:450-1560]]
Ohh, I see what we’re doing…
*104073*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s320_060_son:93-2017]]
It fits! That’s perfect…
*104074*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s320_070_son:35-1348]]
Hey, wait for us…!
*104075*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s320_080_son:50-1500]]
How do we keep those gears from moving?
*104076*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s320_085_son:166-4585]]
You’ve been able to freeze gears with your axe before… What about the ones next to the rope wheel?
*104077*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s320_090_son:11-611]]
That should hold it.
*104078*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s320_100_son:38-693]]
Here we go!
*104079*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s330_010_son:40-1110]]
Do you think this goes all the way up to the top?
*104080*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s330_020_kra:80-1250]]
We will see soon enough.
*104081*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s330_030_son:90-1010]]
Something…
*104082*
[[S:::1450-2730]]
feels strange up there.
*104083*
[[S:::3580-4850]]
We’re heading into danger.
*104084*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s330_040_kra:100-2510]]
Do not concern yourself with what might be.
*104085*
[[S:::3230-4590]]
Focus on what is…
*104086*
[[S:::5100-6000]]
and be vigilant.
*104087*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s330_050_son:17-454]]
Yes, sir.
*104088*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s340_010_son:70-760]]
Not the top…
*104089*
[[S:::1150-1940]]
but we’re closer.
*104090*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s342_010_son:40-400]]
Whoa. What’s it—
*104091*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s342_020_kra:19-568]]
Stay back!
*104092*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s342_030_kra:24-1127]]
More tests.
*104093*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s342_040_son:30-1000]]
Nice moment ruined.
*104094*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s343_010_son:24-631]]
More of ’em!
*104095*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s343_020_kra:90-915]]
The tunnel, boy.
*104096*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s343_030_son:0-380]]
Got it.
*104097*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s343_040_son:18-631]]
Be careful.
*104098*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s345_010_son:135-3889]]
Dwarves must have carved these tunnels around the Giant’s traps. Good thing too.
*104099*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s345_020_son:110-1500]]
Well… good for me anyway.
*104100*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s346_010_son:28-401]]
What the—?
*104101*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s346_020_son:22-1171]]
Oh come ON.
*104102*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s346_030_kra:41-1217]]
That is not helping.
*104103*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s346_070_son:54-1157]]
See you on the other side.
*104104*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s350_010_son:110-3400]]
Another mining lift! It may not be as long a way up as we thought.
*104105*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s350_020_son:60-2500]]
Looks like the only way up is with the lift, somehow.
*104106*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s350_030_son:40-1060]]
How do we make it go?
*104107*
[[S:::1710-2750]]
Maybe we’re too heavy?
*104108*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s350_040_son:19-527]]
That did it!
*104109*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s350_060_son:0-580]]
Or not.
*104110*
[[S:::1020-2000]]
Are we still too heavy?
*104111*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s355_010_son:80-1575]]
All right! We’re moving again.
*104112*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s355_020_son:0-2750]]
Hey, when we get to the summit,
*104113*
[[S:::2800-4350]]
how far do you think we’ll be able to see?
*104114*
[[S:::4600-7850]]
The lake? The World Serpent? Our house?
*104115*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s355_030_kra:210-1670]]
We will see when we get there.
*104116*
[[S:::2070-2750]]
Until then,
*104117*
[[S:::3140-3750]]
eyes open.
*104118*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s360_010_son:0-380]]
Whoa!
*104119*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s360_020_kra:35-574]]
Atreus?!
*104120*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s360_030_son:83-5761]]
I’m fine. Just lost my balance for a moment. You know, for someone so strong, you sure worry a lot.
*104121*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s360_040_kra:140-3000]]
It serves me well… and how I keep us alive.
*104122*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s360_050_son:0-540]]
I guess.
*104123*
[[S:::1050-2500]]
Not a terribly fun way to live though.
*104124*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s365_010_kra:50-1250]]
How was that for “fun?”
*104125*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s365_020_son:0-550]]
I get it.
*104126*
[[S:::910-1710]]
I should worry more.
*104127*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s370_010_son:32-1054]]
Is this where we get off?
*104128*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s370_020_kra:80-1500]]
No. We are stuck.
*104129*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s370_025_son:80-2750]]
I think part of the lift is stuck in that wall.  Can you get it free?
*104130*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s370_030_son:98-1338]]
How much farther do we have to go?
*104131*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s370_040_kra:20-850]]
I do not know.
*104132*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s370_050_son:33-1215]]
Think we’ll get attacked again?
*104133*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s370_060_kra:82-1004]]
Definitely.
*104134*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s370_070_son:30-500]]
Oh boy.
*104135*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s370_080_kra:30-590]]
Yes.
*104136*
[[S:::1060-1750]]
Now, be ready.
*104137*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s375_010_son:18-812]]
Stuck again.
*104138*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s375_020_kra:110-500]]
I know.
*104139*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s375_030_son:80-2850]]
Shouldn’t we get moving? They could be back any moment.
*104140*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s375_040_son:86-1170]]
I think we’re safe now.
*104141*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s375_050_kra:63-1111]]
It would seem.
*104142*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s375_060_son:150-760]]
Father?
*104143*
[[S:::1110-2650]]
After we scatter Mother’s ashes…
*104144*
[[S:::3250-3770]]
what then?
*104145*
[[S:::4300-5020]]
What comes next?
*104146*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s375_070_kra:70-1320]]
Nothing comes next.
*104147*
[[S:::1950-2690]]
We go home.
*104148*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s375_080_son:61-2094]]
That’s it? The adventure is over?
*104149*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s375_090_kra:80-680]]
For now.
*104150*
[[S:::1620-3060]]
But we will have much to do.
*104151*
[[S:::4210-7750]]
You were right earlier—on the boat after cutting down the last tree.
*104152*
[[S:::8550-10840]]
You said it felt like something had changed.
*104153*
[[S:::11430-12190]]
And it has,
*104154*
[[S:::12910-14700]]
and our home is no longer safe.
*104155*
[[S:::15520-16910]]
But it will be again.
*104156*
[[S:::17580-19500]]
And we must continue your training.
*104157*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s375_100_son:0-250]]
Okay.
*104158*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_010_son:21-3198]]
We’re almost at the summit. Nothing’s gonna stop us—
*104159*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_030_son:90-300]]
Aaahh!
*104160*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_040_kra:38-2243]]
Calm yourself, boy! And stay behind me!
*104161*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_050_son:0-600]]
Yes, sir!
*104162*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_060_kra:27-1121]]
Watch the talons!
*104163*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_070_son:32-604]]
Look out!
*104164*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_080_son:26-659]]
Here he comes!
*104165*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_090_son:37-639]]
Watch out!
*104166*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_100_son:71-895]]
What are you doing?!
*104167*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_110_kra:0-750]]
Be ready!
*104168*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s380_120_kra:32-767]]
Hold on!
*104169*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s385_010_son:40-440]]
Phew…
*104170*
[[S:::1420-2250]]
That was intense.
*104171*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s385_020_kra:0-350]]
Hold.
*104172*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s385_030_son:56-1227]]
Whoah… What was that?
*104173*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s385_040_son:23-1638]]
That looks like a root of the Yggdrasil tree!
*104174*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s385_050_son:81-1423]]
Is that its sap?
*104175*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s385_060_kra:40-1080]]
Crystallised sap…
*104176*
[[S:::1730-3000]]
and there is power inside.
*104177*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s385_070_son:0-940]]
Maybe try throwing it?
*104178*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s385_080_son:41-734]]
Incredible!
*104179*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s390_010_son:132-5032]]
I can’t believe we fought a dragon! I was aiming for his eyes, but I kept losing my footing.
*104180*
[[S:::5509-11777]]
Do you think this is their home? Did they move in after the Giants left? Or are they WHY the Giants left?
*104181*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s390_020_kra:40-520]]
Boy.
*104182*
[[S:::1530-4640]]
The air grows thin here. No more questions.
*104183*
[[S:::4640-5130]]
Breathe.
*104184*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s390_030_son:70-430]]
Oh…
*104185*
[[S:::940-1410]]
yes…
*104186*
[[S:::2070-2430]]
I see…
*104187*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s392_010_sin:56-402]]
Ahh!
*104188*
[[S:::702-1076]]
Ahhh! Go away!
*104189*
[[S:::2305-6770]]
Shoo! Shoo! Ahh!  Help! Help!!!
*104190*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s392_020_son:110-2180]]
Do you hear that? It sounds like someone screaming.
*104191*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s393_010_son:129-2049]]
Hey ugly! Over here!
*104192*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s393_020_son:36-738]]
You okay?
*104193*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s393_030_sin:48-701]]
For now!
*104194*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s395_010_kra:0-450]]
GO!
*104195*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s395_020_son:60-2230]]
Father! Try using one of those crystals!
*104196*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s395_030_kra:30-1250]]
Boy! Are you okay?
*104197*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s395_040_son:23-436]]
Yeah!
*104198*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s395_050_kra:60-1140]]
I have a plan!
*104199*
[[S:::1710-4000]]
Be ready to lower the crane on my mark!
*104200*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s395_060_son:62-1812]]
But… I don’t know how this thing works!
*104201*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s395_070_kra:70-1160]]
I do not care!
*104202*
[[S:::1540-2250]]
Be ready!
*104203*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s395_080_kra:32-646]]
NOW!!!
*104204*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s395_090_kra:117-2616]]
Rrrrrrgh!
*104205*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s400_010_sin:0-1200]]
I just need one tooth.
*104206*
[[S:::1640-3180]]
I promise you’re going to like this.
*104207*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s400_020_sin:40-2601]]
Watch where you grab tha… oh… never mind.
*104208*
[[S:::2916-4130]]
So unclean.
*104209*
[[S:::4480-6436]]
So, so unclean.
*104210*
[[S:::8543-9246]]
Oh, the smell!
*104211*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s400_030_sin:100-650]]
Perfect—
*104212*
[[S:::1160-1880]]
that should do…
*104213*
[[S:::2400-2950]]
ugh
*104214*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s410_010_sin:1230-2260]]
Oh..How do I explain this?
*104215*
[[S:::3230-8090]]
I’ve added a new vibrating pattern to the bowstring’s fibres.
*104216*
[[S:::8090-10250]]
Aiming it at that hardened world tree sap will vibrate its patterns to fracture point.
*104217*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s410_020_son:0-940]]
What’s… that mean?
*104218*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s410_030_sin:850-3420]]
It makes certain crystals go boom. Trust me,
*104219*
[[S:::3970-4620]]
you’ll love it.
*104220*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s410_040_sin:110-4000]]
Oh! Oh… I see you figured it out on your own then. Just… Nevermind.
*104221*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_pkp01_s410_050_sin:42-5619]]
I wasn’t just explaining the beautiful and complex artistry of my craft or anything… No, just… anything to help you.
*104222*
[[S:::5619-7086]]
Yup.
*104223*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s420_010_son:136-6422]]
Feels like it wasn’t that long ago we were hunting deer. Now we’ve fought Dark Elves, and trolls, and ogres,
*104224*
[[S:::6422-10399]]
and a dragon! I feel like we can beat anything now.
*104225*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s420_020_kra:170-2230]]
We win because we are determined.
*104226*
[[S:::2640-3340]]
Disciplined.
*104227*
[[S:::3820-6000]]
Not because we feel ourselves superior.
*104228*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s420_030_son:60-1360]]
Sure… I know…
*104229*
[[S:::2030-2590]]
It’s just…
*104230*
[[S:::3230-4360]]
it feels good to be strong.
*104231*
[[S:::4790-5150]]
You know?
*104232*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s420_040_kra:90-640]]
… Yes.
*104233*
[[S:::1110-1500]]
I know.
*104234*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s423_010_kra:29-630]]
Stuck.
*104235*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s423_011_son:0-2500]]
Wonder if there’s another crystal around we could use on those roots?
*104236*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s423_020_son:170-800]]
There we go.
*104237*
[[S:::1560-2270]]
Want me to shatter it?
*104238*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s423_030_son:40-1800]]
Just say the word and I’ll shatter it.
*104239*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s423_040_son:80-1130]]
Oh, I’m gonna like this.
*104240*
[[S:::2080-4100]]
Strange though… that one didn’t completely blow up.
*104241*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s423_050_son:90-3000]]
That crystal… I shot it once, but it’s glowing again…
*104242*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s423_060_kra:80-1690]]
The crystal renews itself.
*104243*
[[S:::2340-2750]]
Useful.
*104244*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s423_070_son:13-461]]
All right!
*104245*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s427_010_son:75-2793]]
Look! There’s a bridge over there. But how do we get to it?
*104246*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s427_020_son:89-3482]]
We gotta find a way to lower that bridge. That has to be the way out of here.
*104247*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s427_030_son:24-321]]
Got it!
*104248*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s427_040_son:20-2400]]
Oh. Guess not. Now it’s stuck on the other side.
*104249*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s427_050_son:65-3731]]
C’mon… we got it to fall halfway. There has to be a way bring it down.
*104250*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s427_060_son:72-2422]]
I will never get tired of shattering things with this.
*104251*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s430_010_son:32-2688]]
It’s getting colder—we must be near the top!
*104252*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s430_020_son:0-1000]]
Not long now, Mom.
*104253*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s440_010_son:124-2733]]
Look! The summit! We’re so close now…
*104254*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s440_020_kra:0-2000]]
Steady, boy. Mind your footing.
*104255*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s440_030_son:40-1180]]
There must be some way up…
*104256*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s450_010_son:116-6966]]
Jötunheim. We’re going to Jötunheim. We’re going to find the long-lost realm of the Giants.
*104257*
[[S:::6966-7445]]
That’s… that’s—
*104258*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s450_020_kra:83-1078]]
Inconvenient.
*104259*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s450_030_son:0-1020]]
Yeah… that’s…
*104260*
[[S:::1500-2600]]
just what I was going to say.
*104261*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s450_040_kra:103-2528]]
Do you remember the way to the Witch’s house?
*104262*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s450_050_son:13-5257]]
Yes. The woods with the blood-red leaves, south of the lake. I know just where to go.
*104263*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s450_060_son:0-2360]]
Hope she made it back from Alfheim and can bring Mimir back.
*104264*
[[S:::3250-3920]]
He seemed nice,
*104265*
[[S:::4890-6000]]
before you cut off his head.
*104266*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s341_010_son:68-848]]
That’s funny…
*104267*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s341_020_kra:15-680]]
How so?
*104268*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s341_030_son:60-1020]]
One hand wrote
*104269*
[[S:::1480-2450]]
“Jötnar only”
*104270*
[[S:::3370-4190]]
and another wrote
*104271*
[[S:::4720-5760]]
“and also Dwarves.”
*104272*
[[S:::6630-7340]]
Should we add to it?
*104273*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp01_s341_040_kra:14-502]]
No.
*104274*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pkp01_s445_010_mmr:34-9225]]
(distant voice)
*104275*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pkp01_s445_020_mmr:38-11169]]
(distant voice)
*104276*

(distant voice)
*104277*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s4554_010_son:0-1400]]
So this is the bridge to Jötunheim?
*104278*
[[S:::1770-3930]]
I guess Mimir will help us figure out how to get through it…
*104279*
[[S:::4300-5500]]
if we can bring him back to life.
*104280*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp01_s4554_020_son:0-1540]]
So this is the bridge to Jötunheim?
*104281*
[[S:::2670-5080]]
This looks like those weird doors we’ve seen.
*104282*
[[S:::6130-7870]]
I guess Mimir will help us figure it all out…
*104283*
[[S:::8850-10000]]
if we can bring him back to life.
*104288*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s010_010_son:105-3277]]
Look at this place… this must be a branch of the World Tree!
*104289*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrbr_s010_020_kra:130-650]]
Boy!
*104290*
[[S:::1120-2000]]
Stay on the path.
*104291*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s010_030_son:40-1250]]
Right. Right, I know…
*104292*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrbr_s020_010_kra:0-500]]
We jump.
*104293*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s020_020_son:42-548]]
Really?
*104294*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrbr_s020_030_mmr:20-500]]
Oh dear…
*104295*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s020_040_son:114-1927]]
BAD IDEEEEEAAAAAAAA!!!
*104296*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s050_010_son:130-4200]]
I can’t believe it was Baldur that came to our house. The Aesir god,
*104297*
[[S:::4630-5210]]
Baldur.
*104298*
[[S:::5660-6460]]
And you fought him…
*104299*
[[S:::6712-7413]]
and won!
*104300*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrbr_s050_020_kra:40-750]]
Who is he?
*104301*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s050_030_son:0-2180]]
One of Odin’s sons—Thor’s brother.
*104302*
[[S:::2492-4343]]
And now he’s hunting us with his nephews?
*104303*
[[S:::4962-5935]]
Why is this happening?
*104304*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrbr_s050_040_kra:40-1880]]
If we can raise the head, you can ask him.
*104305*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s050_050_son:3-398]]
Okay.
*104306*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s050_060_son:76-4315]]
You know… it’s silly, but I secretly hoped we’d find a Giant somewhere in that mountain. 
*104307*
[[S:::4713-9371]]
I guess they really did leave Midgard—except for the serpent. He may be the last of his kind.
*104308*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s050_070_son:50-1610]]
Are you the last of your kind, too?
*104309*
[[S:::2170-3330]]
Is that why you don’t like to talk about—
*104310*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrbr_s050_080_kra:0-750]]
My kind?
*104311*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s050_090_son:60-1590]]
I mean… your family?
*104312*
[[S:::2060-2960]]
Before mother and I.
*104313*
[[S:::3460-4400]]
Where you came from…
*104314*
[[S:::4990-5590]]
a mother?
*104315*
[[S:::5960-6500]]
A father?
*104316*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clrbr_s050_100_kra:130-1750]]
Now is not the time for that.
*104317*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s050_110_son:0-500]]
Yes, sir.
*104318*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrbr_s080_010_mmr:0-2250]]
Well, you gentlemen certainly know how to get around.
*104319*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s110_010_son:31-2801]]
Something about this place always makes me feel like I can fly.
*104320*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrbr_s110_020_mmr:0-4500]]
It’s disorienting, isn’t it? I strongly suggest NOT leaping into the void, though.
*104321*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s130_010_son:0-1720]]
Seems like this should go somewhere,
*104322*
[[S:::2220-2500]]
doesn’t it?
*104323*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrbr_s130_020_mmr:40-3000]]
It goes down. Way, WAY down.
*104324*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrbr_s150_010_mmr:31-2862]]
Well, I’m pretty sure you weren’t talking to me back there.
*104325*
[[S:::3236-5449]]
Anything you’d like to get off your chest, brother?
*104326*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrbr_s150_020_mmr:37-3269]]
I can assure you I’m unsurpassed in keeping confidences.
*104327*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrbr_s150_030_mmr:25-1727]]
Well, you know where to find me.
*104328*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrbr_s150_040_mmr:0-2965]]
And for the record, I’d already guessed you were Greek.
*104329*
[[S:::3430-5333]]
“Athena?” Dead giveaway.
*104330*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s170_010_son:17-1162]]
Is there something down there?
*104331*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrbr_s170_020_mmr:0-4250]]
Yes, bloody oblivion is down there, lad. Please, you’re concerning me.
*104332*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s180_010_son:60-520]]
Hey…
*104333*
[[S:::1130-4250]]
if I’m a god, maybe I CAN fly!
*104334*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrbr_s180_020_mmr:0-4000]]
No, NO! Gods, too, must stay on the path, I promise you..!
*104335*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s230_010_son:0-4708]]
Aw, man… the tower ate the Unity stone, didn’t it? I wanted to fly again…
*104336*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrbr_s230_020_mmr:0-2000]]
Yes, that’s a terrible pity.
*104337*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clrbr_s270_010_son:0-1250]]
Know any more stories, Mimir?
*104338*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clrbr_s270_020_mmr:120-5750]]
Of course, laddie, and yours for the asking. But I prefer the boat. In here is… distracting.
*104339*
[[S::vo_lvl_fthl04_s450_010_son_stem:8620-11260]]
Yeah. But also sad the journey’s almost over.
*104340*
[[S:::13240-17260]]
Oh! What if we get to Jötunheim, and there aren’t any giants there either?
*104341*
[[S:::25410-26700]]
Father, can I tell him?
*104342*
[[S:::50140-54870]]
Let me guess… your brother isn’t as talented as you, and his work is junk.
*104343*
[[S:::57440-61010]]
It’s all you ever talk about, over and over.
*104344*
[[S:::62030-64360]]
Do something about it or shut up already.
*104345*
[[S:::65870-70460]]
Yeah! We’re sick of hearing about little people’s little problems!
*104346*
[[S::vo_lvl_fthl04_s450_010_kra_stem:17450-21290]]
Makes little difference to us. Fulfilling your mother’s wish is what is important.
*104347*
[[S:::26770-27180]]
No.
*104348*
[[S:::36100-36890]]
It is nothing.
*104349*
[[S:::37760-38893]]
A family matter.
*104350*
[[S::vo_lvl_fthl04_s450_010_sin_stem:21490-25306]]
Ah! Don’t go anywhere—be with you in two shakes.
*104351*
[[S:::27790-28403]]
Tell me what?
*104352*
[[S:::30154-31488]]
Did you put this wheel in your mouth?
*104353*
[[S:::32608-35867]]
Oh god, I’ll vomit, I’m not kidding, I’ll throw  up on it…
*104354*
[[S:::43581-48925]]
Oh, I can tell you a thing or two about family matters…
*104355*
[[S:::54900-57233]]
Uh… those things are accurate. Your point?
*104356*
[[S:::64914-65666]]
I see…
*104357*
[[S:::73071-73681]]
Umm…
*104358*
[[S:::75139-75674]]
alright…
*104359*
[[S:::77770-78447]]
That hurt a little.
*104360*
[[S:::81037-82634]]
Let’s have a look at your gear then.
*104361*
[[S::vo_lvl_fthl04_s450_010_mmr_stem:4700-8250]]
So, lad… excited to finally see the land of the Giants?
*104362*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s005_010_son:0-550]]
Great—
*104363*
[[S:::940-2200]]
I guess they’re all coming to life now.
*104364*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_fthl04_s005_020_sin:50-1500]]
Oh look, a different realm,
*104365*
[[S:::1920-2250]]
don’t mind if I do.
*104366*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s006_010_son:230-1750]]
They thought that was gonna stop us? Pfft…
*104367*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s006_020_son:30-370]]
Okay,
*104368*
[[S:::720-1370]]
which way up?
*104369*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s010_010_son:1440-2390]]
Broken again.
*104370*
[[S:::2900-3310]]
You know…
*104371*
[[S:::3680-5310]]
I’m starting to question Sindri’s skill.
*104372*
[[S:::5900-7260]]
Maybe Brok was right all along.
*104373*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl04_s020_010_kra:80-2000]]
Why did you speak to the dwarf like that?
*104374*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s020_020_son:51-2150]]
Aren’t you sick of hearing about him and his brother?
*104375*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl04_s020_030_kra:30-790]]
Of course.
*104376*
[[S:::1280-3200]]
But it serves nothing to make an enemy of him.
*104377*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s020_040_son:0-2000]]
He should know the truth. Even if it hurts.
*104378*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl04_s020_050_kra:160-1750]]
It was needless and unkind.
*104379*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s020_060_son:65-1908]]
Truth is more important than kindness.
*104380*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl04_s020_070_kra:80-1500]]
Your mother would disagree.
*104381*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s020_080_son:20-1232]]
She wasn’t a god.
*104382*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s030_010_son:16-1849]]
Why don’t you let me carry her up from here?
*104383*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl04_s030_020_kra:20-500]]
No.
*104384*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s030_030_son:0-3280]]
Why not? We’re almost there. You know I can handle it!
*104385*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl04_s030_040_kra:90-690]]
Can you?
*104386*
[[S:::1110-2500]]
After the way you spoke of her,
*104387*
[[S:::3020-4000]]
I question that.
*104388*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s030_050_son:0-1250]]
What, that she wasn’t a god?
*104389*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_fthl04_s030_060_kra:130-1990]]
She was better than a god—
*104390*
[[S:::2430-4450]]
and you shall not dishonour her.
*104391*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s030_070_son:0-2000]]
Fine. Carry her yourself.
*104392*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s045_010_son:54-4956]]
Mimir… if you knew all along that we were gods, why come up with that story about Odin trying to
*104393*
[[S:::4956-9807]]
follow us to Jötunheim before we get there, or whatever? Isn’t it a lot simpler if they want us
*104394*
[[S:::9807-12586]]
dead because we’re gods, and they think we’re a threat?
*104395*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_fthl04_s045_020_mmr:28-4765]]
I suppose we can’t rule it out. But Odin’s ways are subtle and his purposes are—
*104396*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s045_030_son:116-3763]]
Ugh, enough about Odin and his whole stupid family.
*104397*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s050_010_son:79-513]]
Whoa!
*104398*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s050_020_son:59-2622]]
Phht… I suppose that’s Odin’s doing too.
*104399*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s050_030_son:0-650]]
Nice try!
*104400*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s060_010_son:0-2110]]
You and mother always said all gods were evil…
*104401*
[[S:::2850-6660]]
but we’re not! Týr wasn’t. Freya neither.
*104402*
[[S:::7510-9090]]
The Aesir gods—that’s who’s evil.
*104403*
[[S:::9800-13240]]
And you know what—Odin’s right. We are a threat.
*104404*
[[S:::13660-15860]]
Cause we know what they are, and we know we can beat them.
*104405*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_fthl04_s060_020_mmr:50-1290]]
Well, not all of them.
*104406*
[[S:::1750-2250]]
Not yet.
*104407*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_fthl04_s060_030_son:0-2120]]
Magni did his worst, and he’s dead.
*104408*
[[S:::3180-4050]]
They’re no better than us.
*104409*
[[S:::4590-6070]]
And they’re gonna be sorry they picked this fight.
*104410*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s010_010_mmr:0-1210]]
Ahh, Alfheim.
*104411*
[[S:::1650-5630]]
I missed its gentle breeze and the sweet smell of honeysuckle and blood.
*104412*
[[S:::6200-6540]]
Well…
*104413*
[[S:::6960-10250]]
judging by the sky, the Light Elves are in control of the Light this time.
*104414*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf02_s010_020_kra:19-815]]
Explain.
*104415*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s010_030_mmr:0-2750]]
You see… the Light Elves and Dark Elves—
*104416*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s010_040_son:0-1460]]
… are always fighting over the Light.
*104417*
[[S:::2240-3000]]
That part we know.
*104418*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s010_050_mmr:0-4340]]
But did you also know that control of the light has changed hands no less than two hundred and
*104419*
[[S:::4340-5250]]
thirteen times?
*104420*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s010_060_son:46-686]]
Really?!
*104421*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s010_070_mmr:0-5943]]
It’s true. Each side believes itself the rightful keepers of the Light and argue they’re simply fighting for survival.
*104422*
[[S:::6290-7579]]
But the fact of the matter is…
*104423*
[[S:::7671-10709]]
the war has been going on so long, they don’t know who they are without it.
*104424*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s020_010_son:0-740]]
So…
*104425*
[[S:::1260-2230]]
clear this up for me…
*104426*
[[S:::3110-7516]]
Svartalfheim means “land of the Dark Elves,” right?
*104427*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s020_020_mmr:36-602]]
Right…
*104428*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s020_030_son:36-5017]]
But you said the Dark Elves have been here in Alfheim a really long time. And anyway… aren’t
*104429*
[[S:::5017-8981]]
dwarves supposed to be from Svartalfheim? They don’t look like Dark Elves.
*104430*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s020_040_mmr:16-5107]]
Don’t you think so? Then you are vastly more perceptive than the Aesir. They’re the ones who
*104431*
[[S:::5107-10308]]
apparently can’t tell the difference, and they’re the ones who came up with that name. Dwarves
*104432*
[[S:::10308-12771]]
actually call their home realm “Niðavellir.”
*104433*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s020_050_son:8-2100]]
So the Dark Elves aren’t from Svartalfheim at all?
*104434*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s020_060_mmr:0-2910]]
Not even a bit. They’re just Elves of another colour.
*104435*
[[S:::3360-6500]]
Nobody knows who came first, but they all come from Alfheim.
*104436*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s020_070_son:0-2160]]
But… why do they fight all the time if they’re really the same?
*104437*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s020_080_mmr:80-2314]]
That… is adorable.
*104438*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s020_090_son:63-665]]
Huh?
*104439*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf02_s020_100_kra:50-1500]]
It is the way of the world.
*104440*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s020_110_son:90-500]]
Oh.
*104441*
[[S:::960-1470]]
Well,
*104442*
[[S:::2060-2750]]
that’s sad…
*104443*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s030_010_son:21-1459]]
We going back into the trench again?
*104444*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s030_020_son:41-705]]
Lögr
*104445*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s030_030_mmr:64-569]]
Huh.
*104446*
[[S:::1042-2296]]
Never knew this was here.
*104447*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s040_010_mmr:0-1190]]
Freyr’s Temple—
*104448*
[[S:::1980-4750]]
the ring is just as beautiful as I’d remembered.
*104449*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf02_s040_020_kra:20-882]]
Freyr?
*104450*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s040_030_son:0-750]]
A Vanir god.
*104451*
[[S:::1740-2880]]
Freya’s brother, actually!
*104452*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s040_040_mmr:0-2430]]
Freyr has a long history with the Elves…
*104453*
[[S:::2870-4500]]
one of the few gods welcome here.
*104454*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s050_010_son:0-520]]
Father,
*104455*
[[S:::1080-1940]]
after what we did—
*104456*
[[S:::2830-4940]]
giving control of the temple back to the Light Elves—
*104457*
[[S:::6180-7400]]
do you think the war is over?
*104458*
[[S:::8290-9500]]
At least, for a while?
*104459*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_alf02_s050_020_kra:20-930]]
No, Atreus.
*104460*
[[S:::1430-3550]]
The Dark Elves may have scattered for now,
*104461*
[[S:::4010-5650]]
but some other will rise to lead them,
*104462*
[[S:::6350-8250]]
and they will surely attack again.
*104463*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_alf02_s050_030_mmr:0-1500]]
Afraid your da’s right, son.
*104464*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_alf02_s050_040_son:96-833]]
I see.
*104465*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s014_010_son:140-1800]]
Is this why I hear voices sometimes?
*104466*
[[S:::2570-4000]]
You sure you’ve never heard any?
*104467*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl09_s014_020_kra:130-1000]]
Not as you do.
*104468*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl09_s014_030_mmr:110-2750]]
That’s no surprise. Every god is unique.
*104469*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s014_040_son:130-810]]
So…
*104470*
[[S:::1250-5000]]
maybe I won’t get strong like father… but I’ll have abilities all my own?
*104471*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl09_s014_050_mmr:180-1570]]
You already do, laddy!
*104472*
[[S:::2030-5350]]
Your faculty for language is extraordinary for one so young.
*104473*
[[S:::5910-7770]]
Time alone will tell what else
*104474*
[[S:::8320-8950]]
you’ll become capable of.
*104475*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s014_060_son:170-1250]]
So… you knew all along.
*104476*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl09_s014_070_mmr:90-980]]
I did, lad.
*104477*
[[S:::1340-3500]]
But I’ve known more than my share of gods.
*104478*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s014_080_son:90-960]]
Me too, apparently.
*104479*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s016_010_son:100-1600]]
I wonder who else knew I was a god…
*104480*
[[S:::2300-3130]]
Freya for sure…
*104481*
[[S:::3730-4480]]
Brok and Sindri?
*104482*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl09_s016_020_kra:140-1500]]
They do not need to know.
*104483*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s016_030_son:72-7993]]
(gasps) Baldur! Does he know? Is that why he’s after us? Do you know him from before?
*104484*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl09_s016_040_kra:180-3530]]
The day of your mother’s funeral was the first I ever saw Baldur.
*104485*
[[S:::4570-5500]]
That is the truth.
*104486*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s020_010_son:70-3570]]
Hey—we don’t have to go right back to Týr’s Vault, do we?
*104487*
[[S:::4440-7990]]
I mean… we’re gods! We can do whatever we want, right?
*104488*
[[S:::8560-10000]]
What do you really feel like doing right now?
*104489*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl09_s020_020_kra:30-750]]
I will show you.
*104490*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s030_010_son:50-860]]
Let’s try this again…
*104491*
[[S:::1250-2500]]
without interruptions.
*104492*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s040a_010_son:34-842]]
Here we go again…
*104493*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s040b_010_son:0-440]]
You ready?
*104494*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl09_s040c_010_kra:0-500]]
Read it.
*104495*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s040c_020_son:0-1380]]
“Death itself I swallow /
*104496*
[[S:::1770-3250]]
To spring forth life tomorrow.”
*104497*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl09_s040c_030_mmr:510-1680]]
Oh… I like that one.
*104498*
[[S:::2260-3440]]
I wonder if I wrote it…
*104499*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl09_s040d_010_kra:0-1120]]
The bowl’s answer?
*104500*
[[S:::1760-2750]]
In plain sight?
*104501*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s040d_020_son:0-749]]
It says “Earth.”
*104502*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl09_s040e_010_kra:38-1283]]
Is that the answer there?
*104503*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s040e_020_son:33-992]]
It says “Earth.”
*104504*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl09_s040e_030_mmr:170-2750]]
Mm. Swallows death, brings forth life…
*104505*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl09_s040f_010_kra:0-500]]
Read it.
*104506*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s040f_020_son:0-1380]]
“Death itself I swallow /
*104507*
[[S:::1770-3250]]
To spring forth life tomorrow.”
*104508*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl09_s040f_030_mmr:0-2310]]
Oh… I like that one. I wonder if I wrote it…
*104509*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl09_s040f_040_kra:0-250]]
Go.
*104510*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s040f_050_son:76-709]]
Jörð…
*104511*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl09_s040g_010_kra:0-450]]
Go.
*104512*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl09_s040g_020_son:76-709]]
Jörð…
*104513*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp02_s460_010_mdi_stem:2270-2900]]
Thor...
*104514*
[[S:::3890-4670]]
blamed me...
*104515*
[[S:::6480-7100]]
ME...
*104516*
[[S:::8010-9560]]
for what you did to Magni.
*104517*
[[S:::11140-12070]]
My own father
*104518*
[[S:::12470-13420]]
called me a coward...
*104519*
[[S:::20775-22295]]
I’ll kill you—!
*104520*
[[S:::23010-26854]]
Aah!! Aah... aah...
*104521*
[[S:::51752-60080]]
Hehehehe... that’s what I said to your mother... Right before I gave it to her.
*104522*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp02_s460_010_son_stem:15900-17250]]
Looks like he did more than that.
*104523*
[[S:::17860-20721]]
Move it or we’ll pick up where he left off.
*104524*
[[S:::39300-41542]]
He should pay for what he said about mother.
*104525*
[[S:::44910-46313]]
But we’re gods.
*104526*
[[S:::47587-51516]]
We can do whatever. We. Want.
*104527*
[[S:::66421-68256]]
This is a much better knife than Mother’s.
*104528*
[[S:::80516-82190]]
Haven’t you been teaching me to kill?
*104529*
[[S:::102624-106503]]
Nobody cared about him anyways. What’s the difference?
*104530*
[[S:::109127-111494]]
Why? How do you know?
*104531*
[[S:::112274-113661]]
How do you know!?
*104532*
[[S:::121178-121984]]
Whatever.
*104533*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp02_s460_010_kra_stem:33020-33480]]
No.
*104534*
[[S:::35270-36090]]
He is beaten—
*104535*
[[S:::36920-37940]]
not worth killing.
*104536*
[[S:::41580-43350]]
I said no.
*104537*
[[S:::63140-64300]]
What are you doing?!
*104538*
[[S:::74170-76200]]
You killed against my wishes.
*104539*
[[S:::77350-78470]]
You lost control.
*104540*
[[S:::81860-83830]]
I have been teaching you to survive.
*104541*
[[S:::85080-86330]]
We are gods, boy…
*104542*
[[S:::87640-89100]]
and that makes us a target.
*104543*
[[S:::89730-91600]]
From now until the end of days,
*104544*
[[S:::92060-93000]]
you are marked.
*104545*
[[S:::94103-96660]]
So I teach you to kill, yes…
*104546*
[[S:::97245-101335]]
but in defence of yourself. Never as an indulgence.
*104547*
[[S:::106364-109020]]
There are consequences to killing a god.
*104548*
[[S:::114660-119362]]
Watch your tone, boy.
*104549*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp02_s470_010_son_stem:7120-7670]]
Wow.
*104550*
[[S:::8840-9590]]
Jötunheim.
*104551*
[[S:::11650-12190]]
We made it.
*104552*
[[S:::38131-39955]]
No! I’m a god too!
*104553*
[[S:::40200-40949]]
I can do this!
*104554*
[[S:::41450-42417]]
Get off him!
*104555*
[[S:::80583-82837]]
NO!!!! You broke the gate!
*104556*
[[S:::82889-84715]]
That was our only way to Jötunheim!
*104557*
[[S:::106069-107000]]
Let GO!!!
*104558*
[[S:::109607-110972]]
I AM ready!!!
*104559*
[[S:::114289-115595]]
Þruma—!!
*104560*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp02_s470_010_mmr_stem:18760-20150]]
Beautiful, isn’t it?
*104561*
[[S:::20580-21690]]
Why, I remember once—
*104562*
[[S:::22340-22940]]
Brother! Look ou—
*104563*
[[S:::51440-54244]]
Baldur. Let ’em go. Take me instead. I’ll do whatever you—
*104564*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp02_s470_010_bld_stem:26081-27563]]
Miss me?
*104565*
[[S:::42415-43584]]
Really?
*104566*
[[S:::54292-55401]]
Shut up.
*104567*
[[S:::55792-58238]]
All this time, I thought I needed you!
*104568*
[[S:::59640-61569]]
But, you’re just meat!
*104569*
[[S:::62717-65272]]
Turns out, the boy’s the brains!
*104570*
[[S:::84788-90404]]
Oh, you stupid son of a bitch!
*104571*
[[S:::95992-103423]]
Yes… by all means, junior, run away. Let daddy do all the heavy lifting for you.
*104572*
[[S:::121196-124018]]
And here I thought my family was fucked up…
*104573*
[[S:::129023-131343]]
Aww… your father is right boy.
*104574*
[[S:::131343-133389]]
You are far from ready.
*104575*
[[S:::133389-136313]]
Now, would you be so kind as to hold this for me?
*104576*
[[S:::137865-138382]]
Thank you.
*104577*
[[S::vo_lvl_pkp02_s470_010_kra_stem:35101-36302]]
Run, boy!
*104578*
[[S:::36410-37501]]
Cross the bridge!
*104579*
[[S:::69221-71743]]
RAAAAAA!
*104580*
[[S:::93873-95263]]
Get out of here, boy!
*104581*
[[S:::107013-108061]]
Calm DOWN, boy!
*104582*
[[S:::108502-109600]]
You are NOT ready for this.
*104583*
[[S:::113005-114200]]
Boy… I…
*104584*
[[S:::141976-143131]]
ATREUS!!
*104585*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s020_010_son:40-1160]]
Why are we going this way?
*104586*
[[S:::1880-3000]]
Did we miss something back here?
*104587*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s030_010_son:50-2500]]
Maybe I should have rolled Modi in there with all the other dead guys…..
*104588*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s030_020_son:0-320]]
What?
*104589*
[[S:::990-3000]]
You feel like crawling on top of dead bodies again?
*104590*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s040_010_son:0-2000]]
Pretty sure there’s nothing else for us here.
*104591*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp02_s060_010_kra:90-4500]]
Keep your wits about you, boy. If Modi found us, Baldur cannot be far.
*104592*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s060_020_son:10-500]]
Good.
*104593*
[[S:::1010-2290]]
I have a few words for him too…
*104594*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp02_s060_030_kra:50-1100]]
No, you do not.
*104595*
[[S:::1450-2500]]
You will leave him to me.
*104596*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s060_040_son:60-1200]]
So you can kill him.
*104597*
[[S:::1810-5750]]
Cause that’s what we do to our enemies. RIGHT? Cause he’d do the same to us?
*104598*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp02_s060_050_kra:80-2250]]
I will do only what is necessary.
*104599*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s060_060_son:50-750]]
And I’ll help.
*104600*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp02_s060_070_kra:90-350]]
NO.
*104601*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s070_010_son:0-680]]
Oh yeah,
*104602*
[[S:::1030-1600]]
this room.
*104603*
[[S:::2320-3250]]
But we need a new way up.
*104604*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s080_010_son:20-2250]]
You know there’s no way up this way, right?
*104605*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp02_s090_005_kra:10-888]]
Destroyed…
*104606*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s090_010_son:40-3760]]
Even if we could take the cart up, the next platform broke when we fought the dragon.
*104607*
[[S:::4290-5210]]
Did you already forget?
*104608*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s100_010_son:20-1458]]
I can’t learn if you won’t teach me.
*104609*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp02_s100_020_kra:0-1450]]
You do not heed my lessons.
*104610*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s100_030_son:50-3657]]
I’ve done everything you asked, and all I wanted was the truth.
*104611*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s100_040_son:0-1506]]
Where did you get your fire blades?
*104612*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s100_050_son:0-1000]]
Why did you hide them?
*104613*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s100_060_son:50-2270]]
You said there are consequences to killing a god.
*104614*
[[S:::3230-4503]]
You used the blades to kill one?
*104615*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s100_070_son:0-2160]]
Who else did you kill, before Magni?
*104616*
[[S:::2920-3500]]
How many?
*104617*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s100_080_son:170-900]]
Do you hear me?
*104618*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp02_s100_090_kra:160-4750]]
I heard you, and these are not subjects for discussion. Do not push me, boy.
*104619*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s100_100_son:38-788]]
Fine.
*104620*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s100_110_son:56-6570]]
Mimir, guess what. I know everything I need to know now. I have nothing else to learn.
*104621*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pkp02_s100_120_mmr:100-2323]]
Uh… congratulations?
*104622*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp02_s102_010_kra:47-1184]]
What does this say?
*104623*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s102_020_son:38-2298]]
It says… “Don’t wake him”.
*104624*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s102_020_son_a:77-1768]]
It says… “Don’t wake him”.
*104625*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s102_030_son:50-780]]
Whatever.
*104626*
[[S:::1411-3048]]
We’ve killed everything else in this mountain!
*104627*
[[S:::3742-4847]]
Who else wants a taste?
*104628*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp02_s102_040_kra:0-1000]]
What does this say?
*104629*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s102_050_son:46-2551]]
It says… “Don’t wake him”.
*104630*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s102_060_son:0-500]]
Nice one.
*104631*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pkp02_s103_010_mmr:0-1020]]
Brothers, be warned—
*104632*
[[S:::1370-4906]]
the tunnels I’m seeing in the walls up here show signs of recent Dragon activity—!
*104633*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp02_s103_020_kra:50-1826]]
We already killed that dragon.
*104634*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pkp02_s103_030_mmr:0-373]]
Ah.
*104635*
[[S:::930-1510]]
Did ya then?
*104636*
[[S:::2130-2560]]
Well.

[[S:::2987-3717]]
How’d that go?
*104638*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pkp02_s110_010_mmr:60-1440]]
Come ON, you two…
*104639*
[[S:::1840-3604]]
the silence is getting unnerving.
*104640*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s110_020_son:44-1095]]
Don’t worry about it.
*104641*
[[S:::1458-2355]]
We’re focusing.
*104642*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pkp02_s120_010_mmr:50-890]]
Nearly there now!
*104643*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s120_020_son:47-815]]
Finally…
*104644*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp02_s130_010_kra:50-1250]]
Boy, the rune.
*104645*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s130_020_son:0-950]]
Carve along that.
*104646*
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_pkp02_s135_010_bld:14502-16793]]

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s095_020_son:5-3431]]
Oh, are you talking to me? Thought you didn’t like my tone.
*104663*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pkp02_s095_030_kra:0-1500]]
Have you forgotten your training?
*104664*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pkp02_s095_040_son:2-572]]
Guess so!
*104665*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pkp02_s125_010_mmr:0-3400]]
Well. There’s a sight no man should ever see. Thanks for that.
*104666*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl11_s010_010_son:175-2900]]
Wait? Aren’t we looking for Brok? He’s back there!
*104667*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl11_s010_020_son:110-4470]]
That key has gotta be for that crazy door downstairs, hidden around the back. Remember?
*104668*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl11_s010_021_mmr:90-3250]]
And beyond that, hopefully some trace of a secret path to Jötunheim!
*104669*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl11_s010_030_son:110-2480]]
Now we just need to figure out what door this key opens.
*104670*
[[S:::3230-4750]]
It has to be somewhere around the temple…
*104671*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl11_s010_040_mmr:0-3250]]
And beyond that, hopefully some trace of a secret path to Jötunheim!
*104672*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl11_s020_010_son:50-2320]]
Oh, you’re right—now that we’ve got the key,
*104673*
[[S:::2320-5110]]
we can open that big door any time we want. Let’s explore!
*104674*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s350_010_sin_stem:2660-6669]]
Wow, that was… uh… something, that uh, fight.
*104675*
[[S:::7230-8603]]
Here, catch!
*104676*
[[S:::10080-13057]]
Well that was a waste of a perfectly good apple.
*104677*
[[S:::15970-18363]]
Ah. That.
*104678*
[[S:::19626-24136]]
It’s a little trick my people can pull… a special way of not being seen.
*104679*
[[S:::26430-33041]]
More like I can step into the realm between realms…and your mind doesn’t understand what it’s seeing, so
*104680*
[[S:::33621-35236]]
it sees nothing at all.
*104681*
[[S:::35585-39366]]
That’s how we avoid ever having to actually use the weapons we craft.
*104682*
[[S:::42670-47055]]
It, uh…it doesn’t seem to work on dragons though.
*104683*
[[S:::52248-57376]]
Brok was asking about me? Was there mead on his breath?
*104684*
[[S:::63846-66067]]
You let him touch this again.
*104685*
[[S:::76362-77995]]
Come on then…
*104686*
[[S:::88630-93421]]
Okay, now shush! I need complete silence for this…
*104687*
[[S:::96477-97713]]
There ya go!
*104688*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s350_010_kra_stem:12006-13527]]
How were you not seen?
*104689*
[[S:::13900-16377]]
There is nowhere here to hide.
*104690*
[[S:::97621-100266]]
Rrrrn.
*104691*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s350_010_son_stem:24390-26044]]
You can be invisible?
*104692*
[[S:::47310-49731]]
Your brother wanted to know if you were getting enough to eat.
*104693*
[[S:::50242-51839]]
I guess I can tell him you are!
*104694*
[[S:::83179-88350]]
So that’s how Brok was in the temple right after the water dropped. He stepped between realms!
*104695*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s355a_010_son_stem:4178-4965]]
Yes, sir.
*104696*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s355a_010_kra_stem:534-994]]
Ready?
*104697*
[[S:::1840-3756]]
Dig in and push with everything.
*104698*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s355b_010_son_stem:4548-6000]]
How do we get down?
*104699*
[[S:::6768-7664]]
Really?
*104700*
[[S:::15931-17508]]
Why would I panic?!
*104701*
[[S:::17755-18558]]
Whoa!!
*104702*
[[S:::39987-40668]]
Uh huh.
*104703*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s355b_010_kra_stem:6000-6768]]
We jump!
*104704*
[[S:::7664-8353]]
Come!
*104705*
[[S:::14564-15900]]
Do not panic!
*104706*
[[S:::19843-21331]]
I have you!
*104707*
[[S:::38642-39930]]
Hhng. You are well?
*104708*
[[S:::40668-43017]]
Good. We should keep moving.
*104709*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s355b_010_mmr_stem:35630-37450]]
You’re cracked, you know that?
*104710*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s358_010_mmr_stem:3150-3750]]
Hurry, brother.
*104711*
[[S:::4130-7200]]
We may get a piece of the chisel and be gone before they even notice.
*104712*
[[S:::12045-12933]]
Uh oh.
*104713*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s358_010_mgi_stem:12900-15624]]
You.
*104714*
[[S:::20110-24325]]
Surrender. The Allfather demands it.
*104715*
[[S:::29451-30840]]
Good.
*104716*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s358_010_kra_stem:16581-17396]]
Boy—
*104717*
[[S:::24556-25335]]
No.
*104718*
[[S:::31830-34429]]
This fight is mine, boy. GO.
*104719*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s358_010_mdi_stem:37810-39520]]
And where do you think you’re goin’?
*104720*
[[S:::40400-41830]]
Oh no. Brother!
*104721*
[[S:::42300-47174]]
The little freak’s got a bow! What are we gonna do?
*104722*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s360_010_mdi_stem:300-1343]]
Magni!
*104723*
[[S:::2059-2924]]
NO—!!
*104724*
[[S:::4938-5615]]
How did you…?
*104725*
[[S:::7187-8893]]
You have no idea what…
*104726*
[[S:::9279-10493]]
You son of a bitch!
*104727*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s360_010_son_stem:10500-11381]]
You’re next!
*104728*
[[S:::11653-13710]]
Come back, you damn coward!
*104729*
[[S:::13867-15394]]
I’ll rip your head off!! GAAH!!!!
*104730*
[[S:::32640-32950]]
No!
*104731*
[[S:::35100-36300]]
It hasn’t…
*104732*
[[S:::41600-42861]]
NO.
*104733*
[[S:::50220-50980]]
I’ll be alright…
*104734*
[[S:::56665-57910]]
I’m fine. See?
*104735*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s360_010_kra_stem:26309-27303]]
The sickness…
*104736*
[[S:::28470-29804]]
the fever has returned.
*104737*
[[S:::36320-36720]]
Boy…
*104738*
[[S:::45630-46000]]
Steady…
*104739*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc01_s360_010_mmr_stem:38330-39670]]
The coughing… the blood…
*104740*
[[S:::40200-41590]]
The boy’s sick. He needs Freya.
*104741*
[[S:::52430-53250]]
There you go, lad…
*104742*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s020_010_kra:0-750]]
We seek a chisel?
*104743*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s020_020_mmr:0-1200]]
The tip of one, yes…
*104744*
[[S:::1690-3750]]
a very, very giant chisel.
*104745*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s030_010_mmr:0-1750]]
Magically sealed, I’m afraid.
*104746*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s040_010_son:11-2132]]
That big crystal on the Giant’s ring looks promising…
*104747*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s040_020_mmr:0-2250]]
Brother, looks like that crystal’s brimming again.
*104748*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s040_030_son:1-2006]]
Darn. That didn’t seem to do anything.
*104749*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s040_040_mmr:0-1500]]
Ooo. Neat trick, lad.
*104750*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s040_050_son:1-422]]
Thanks.
*104751*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s040_060_son:8-717]]
His idea.
*104752*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s050_010_son:11-1127]]
What happened to the survivors?
*104753*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s050_010_son_a:11-1127]]
What happened to the survivors?
*104754*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s050_020_mmr:50-2850]]
Oh, Thamur was a Frost Giant.
*104755*
[[S:::3210-5750]]
When he died, his final breath froze everything.
*104756*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s060_010_son:10-775]]
There he is…
*104757*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s060_020_mmr:0-1506]]
Find the tip of that chisel.
*104758*
[[S:::1702-2800]]
That’s the magic we need.
*104759*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s070_010_son:0-1040]]
An Alfheim light crystal.
*104760*
[[S:::1670-2250]]
Wonder what it’s for?
*104761*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s070_020_son:3-1468]]
The crystal! There it is!
*104762*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s080_010_son:0-2470]]
A light crystal base? But where’s the crystal?
*104763*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s080_020_son:0-1624]]
Well here’s the base for the crystal we saw.
*104764*
[[S:::2100-2702]]
But...
*104765*
[[S:::2760-3575]]
how do we get it down?
*104766*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s090_010_son:7-2702]]
Hey! Hardened world tree sap. That’s handy.
*104767*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s100_010_son:1-419]]
That did it!
*104768*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s105_010_son:0-2000]]
“To Njörd we offer back the sea’s bounty.”
*104769*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s105_020_mmr:160-4710]]
Ah, yes. It was believed that Njörd calmed the winds and seas for the fishermen.
*104770*
[[S:::5190-7250]]
For that, they loved and worshipped him here.
*104771*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s110_010_son:0-750]]
How we getting down there?
*104772*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s110_020_kra:0-750]]
I have a plan.
*104773*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s110_030_mmr:5-608]]
You do?
*104774*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s110_040_kra:0-1250]]
Do not act so surprised.
*104775*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s110_050_mmr:120-970]]
No offence, brother,
*104776*
[[S:::1350-5000]]
but I don’t even think Thor with Mjolnir in hand could get through that much ice.
*104777*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s110_060_kra:2-1380]]
Then Thor is a fool.
*104778*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s110_070_mmr:0-1000]]
This should be entertaining…
*104779*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s110_080_kra:39-458]]
Boy.
*104780*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s110_090_son:8-351]]
Ready.
*104781*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s120_010_son:5-1431]]
Look! Is that Sindri up there?
*104782*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_smc01_s120_020_sin:70-1510]]
Oh, hey.
*104783*
[[S:::1980-2870]]
You again!
*104784*
[[S:::3410-4170]]
Come on up!
*104785*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s140_003_son:0-1500]]
So! This plan of yours…
*104786*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s140_004_kra:0-690]]
Can you guess it?
*104787*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s140_005_son:0-616]]
Knowing you,
*104788*
[[S:::862-2250]]
it doesn’t involve standing around here.
*104789*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s140_006_kra:15-607]]
Correct.
*104790*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s140_007_son:22-1168]]
But how do we move forward?
*104791*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s140_010_son:0-2250]]
Boy. Thamur really liked jewellery didn’t he?
*104792*
[[S:::2845-4163]]
He even braided his beard with it.
*104793*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s140_020_mmr:0-2590]]
I happen to think he looks dashing…
*104794*
[[S:::3010-4180]]
you know… for a snow-covered corpse.
*104795*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s140_030_son:0-2500]]
Wait, there’s one of those shatter crystals in his jewellery.
*104796*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_smc01_s140_040_sin:73-2489]]
Careful! My shop’s RIGHT HERE!
*104797*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s150_010_son:0-990]]
We heading into that building?
*104798*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s150_020_kra:4-445]]
Yes.
*104799*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s150_030_son:12-3273]]
You think there’s something inside that’ll help us break the ice and get to the chisel tip?
*104800*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s150_040_kra:0-394]]
No.
*104801*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s150_050_son:10-1656]]
Hmm… I’ll keep thinking.
*104802*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s160_010_son:0-390]]
Mimir.
*104803*
[[S:::910-1710]]
You knew this place?
*104804*
[[S:::2150-2480]]
Before?
*104805*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s160_020_mmr:0-4960]]
Aye, came here on a diplomatic mission once, trying to broker a peace between Asgard and Vanaheim.
*104806*
[[S:::5800-6330]]
That war—
*104807*
[[S:::7030-8330]]
so many lives lost.
*104808*
[[S:::9290-13204]]
What I didn’t know was Thor had already gone on a killing spree of Giants.
*104809*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s160_030_son:9-2361]]
What did the Giants have to do with the war between the gods?
*104810*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s160_040_mmr:0-3040]]
Nothing at all, lad, that’s the tragedy of it.
*104811*
[[S:::3590-5510]]
They took no side in that madness…
*104812*
[[S:::6410-10250]]
but Odin’s paranoia is surpassed only by Thor’s lust for blood.
*104813*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s170_010_son:1-1748]]
Another crystal… just give the word.
*104814*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s170_020_son:22-1316]]
Huh. What now?
*104815*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s170_030_son:180-1698]]
Ooh, we got most of it…
*104816*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s170_040_mmr:0-530]]
Well!
*104817*
[[S:::990-2250]]
A stealthy plan it is not.
*104818*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s170_050_kra:60-1500]]
Now we must free the other strap.
*104819*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s170_060_son:17-537]]
We do?
*104820*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s180_010_son:0-2190]]
Why are we going up when what we need is all the way down there?
*104821*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s180_020_kra:10-517]]
Think.
*104822*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s180_030_son:0-430]]
Well…
*104823*
[[S:::1100-4380]]
the chisel tip is under thick layers of ice, so melting it won’t work.
*104824*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s180_040_kra:5-475]]
Correct.
*104825*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s180_050_son:1-4057]]
And there weren’t any Shatter Crystals nearby for me to shoot, so that’s not an option.
*104826*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s180_060_kra:1-493]]
Correct.
*104827*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s180_070_son:0-6770]]
That just leaves smashing the ice. But we’d need something ridiculously heavy to—Ohhhhh. I get it now.
*104828*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s180_080_kra:2-511]]
Good.
*104829*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s190_010_son:8-2586]]
How are we going to turn the hammer so it lands near the chisel tip?
*104830*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s190_020_kra:0-910]]
Not possible.
*104831*
[[S:::1300-5250]]
We cut it free, ride it down, and figure out what comes next after.
*104832*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s190_030_son:0-2000]]
So your plan involves a whole bunch of luck then.
*104833*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s190_040_kra:0-2340]]
You are welcome to suggest a different one.
*104834*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s200_010_son:0-400]]
What now?
*104835*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s200_020_kra:0-730]]
Hold tight.
*104836*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s200_030_mmr:9-418]]
Uh.
*104837*
[[S:::867-2750]]

“Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn”?

*104854*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s210_430_son:1-1567]]
It’s from a song mother used to sing.

Whew.
*105015*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s220_020_kra:0-500]]
You did well.
*105016*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s220_030_mmr:14-545]]
Thanks!
*105017*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s220_040_kra:8-716]]
The boy…
*105018*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s220_050_mmr:0-2000]]
Just having a little fun, you big grump.
*105019*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s230_010_son:0-880]]
Well there it is.
*105020*
[[S:::1330-2250]]
How are we going to get it free?
*105021*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s230_020_kra:2-564]]
A push.
*105022*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s230_030_son:4-164]]
But—
*105023*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s230_040_kra:0-500]]
Trust me.
*105024*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s240_010_son:3-668]]
The chisel tip!
*105025*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s240_020_mmr:0-3250]]
Give the man credit. He has a talent for destroying things.
*105026*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s240_030_kra:0-1000]]
Remember that, head.
*105027*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s240_040_mmr:0-1000]]
Never leaves my mind…
*105028*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s250_010_mgi:130-1000]]
Where are they?!
*105029*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s250_020_mdi:110-1880]]
Ugh. I fucking hate Midgard.
*105030*
[[S:::2360-3500]]
How do we know they’re even here?
*105031*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s250_030_mgi:117-2699]]
Because that hammer didn’t fall on its own.
*105032*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s250_040_mdi:110-2690]]
Well… If we find them, I get the kid, right?
*105033*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s250_050_mgi:63-2370]]
What is the matter with you?
*105034*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s250_060_mgi:50-970]]
I smell a dwarf.
*105035*
[[S:::1680-2250]]
Find him.
*105036*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s250_070_son:3-462]]
Father—
*105037*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s250_080_kra:0-500]]
Not now.
*105038*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s260_010_son:1-2382]]
Those were the guys we saw with Baldur. His nephews?
*105039*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s260_020_mmr:0-560]]
Aye.
*105040*
[[S:::980-2440]]
Magni and Modi—
*105041*
[[S:::2830-4000]]
the sons of Thor.
*105042*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s260_030_son:0-3850]]
Mother always said the Aesir were the worst of the gods, and Thor was the worst of the Aesir.
*105043*
[[S:::4550-5940]]
Guess he’s a terrible father, too.
*105044*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s260_040_kra:0-1490]]
They are no longer children.
*105045*
[[S:::1850-2730]]
They have no excuse.
*105046*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s260_050_son:0-910]]
Will Sindri be okay?
*105047*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s260_060_mmr:6-1190]]
They’ll never even see him.
*105048*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s270_010_mmr:0-3450]]
Ah, the great dining hall. Envy of all Midgard.
*105049*
[[S:::4010-4420]]
Funny,
*105050*
[[S:::4970-7290]]
I remember there being a massive candelabrum.
*105051*
[[S:::7780-9000]]
Really livened up the place…
*105052*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s270_020_kra:0-500]]
There.
*105053*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s270_030_mmr:18-634]]
Ah yes.
*105054*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s270_040_mmr:0-2000]]
You just can’t help but break things, can you?
*105055*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s270_050_mmr:0-3750]]
If memory serves, the jarl’s throne was just on the other side of that wall of ice.
*105056*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s270_060_son:0-1215]]
I think we can get through there!
*105057*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s270_070_son:0-1662]]
I think I see a throne on the other side.
*105058*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s270_080_son:0-718]]
Almost through.
*105059*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s270_090_son:0-2410]]
I can see a path out, but there’s no way to reach it.
*105060*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s276_010_son:60-1570]]
I think this is Njörd’s own mark.
*105061*
[[S:::2440-4000]]
The god they worshipped came to dinner?
*105062*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s276_020_mmr:39-5551]]
Sounds like Njörd to me. Affable fellow, formidable drinker. The Vanir always were a more
*105063*
[[S:::5551-7878]]
personable sort of god than the Aesir.
*105064*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s280_005_kra:22-2303]]
Shh—something ahead…
*105065*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_smc01_s280_006_mmr:0-1561]]
See, lad? He’s fine.
*105066*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_smc01_s280_007_sin:0-3170]]
Thought it best to vanish when Thor’s idiot sons showed up.
*105067*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s280_010_mgi:40-2750]]
Will you focus on your damn job and quit that shit.
*105068*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_smc01_s280_011_sin:0-1183]]
Speaking of which…
*105069*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s280_020_mdi:0-1250]]
You quit that shit.
*105070*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s280_030_mgi:40-910]]
I mean it!
*105071*
[[S:::1410-4927]]
He went to war with Uncle and walked away.
*105072*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s280_040_mdi:30-810]]
Maybe.
*105073*
[[S:::1650-3374]]
Uncle hasn’t seen straight in years.
*105074*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s280_050_mgi:30-2805]]
Well, as long as father believes him, so do we.
*105075*
[[S:::2954-7410]]
So you will stop talking, focus, and help me find them.
*105076*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s280_060_mdi:48-2113]]
Can’t disappoint father!
*105077*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s280_070_mgi:120-2219]]
Oh, I’ll smack you boy.
*105078*
[[S:::2570-6000]]
No, we cannot disappoint father. Now keep looking!
*105079*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s291_010_mdi:40-1750]]
The small one’s yours, Brother.
*105080*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s291_020_mgi:63-2715]]
You don’t tell me what to do, Brother.
*105081*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s291_030_mgi:48-3439]]
I can’t remember the last time we faced an actual challenge.
*105082*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s291_030_mgi_a:40-5500]]
I can’t remember the last time we faced an actual challenge.
*105083*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s291_040_mdi:0-4290]]
You call this a challenge? An old man and this stillborn lamb?
*105084*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s291_040_mdi_a:40-1650]]
You call this a challenge?
*105085*
[[S:::2170-3310]]
An old man and this
*105086*
[[S:::3660-4590]]
stillborn lamb?
*105087*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s291_050_mgi:1410-5700]]
Unbelievable. You mean to oppose the might of Asgard?
*105088*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s291_060_mdi:0-1850]]
You’ve got some father, kid.
*105089*
[[S:::2650-4250]]
I almost feel bad for you!
*105090*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s292_010_mgi:40-1250]]
I will cripple you!
*105091*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s292_020_mgi:30-1750]]
You mean to oppose us?!
*105092*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s292_030_mgi:0-900]]
Finally!
*105093*
[[S:::1270-2000]]
A challenge!
*105094*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s292_040_mdi:52-1976]]
Fucking freaks!
*105095*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s292_050_mdi:78-2386]]
Gonna break all your fingers…
*105096*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s292_060_mdi:42-2406]]
Gonna have a good time with you, kid!
*105097*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s293_010_mgi:0-600]]
Enough!
*105098*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s293_020_mgi:28-926]]
’Offa me!
*105099*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s293_030_mgi:27-895]]
Back off!
*105100*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s293_040_mgi:0-500]]
URGGH!
*105101*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s293_050_mgi:61-576]]
RAWRH!
*105102*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s293_060_mdi:19-1011]]
Fuck off!
*105103*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s293_070_mdi:24-648]]
Stop!
*105104*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s293_080_mdi:29-681]]
Blindr!
*105105*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s293_110_mdi:20-440]]
Ha!

Hrya!
*105107*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294_010_mgi:33-747]]
Weak!
*105108*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294_020_mgi:41-877]]
Too slow!
*105109*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294_030_mgi:0-750]]
Try again!
*105110*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294_040_mgi:0-450]]
GRAAHH!!
*105111*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294_050_mdi:184-1058]]
Sad!
*105112*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294_060_mdi:30-1173]]
Worthless!
*105113*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294_070_mdi:63-1185]]
Boring!

[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_010_mgi:30-4000]]
Don’t fool yourself. You’ll fuck this up too, Modi! I guarantee it.
*105175*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_020_mgi:40-2250]]
But can you finish the job, brother?
*105176*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_030_mgi:20-1450]]
Not bad, brother!
*105177*
[[S:::2060-4000]]
I’ll let father know you helped a little!
*105178*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_030_mgi_a:0-1180]]
Not bad, brother!
*105179*
[[S:::1620-3000]]
I’ll let father know you helped.
*105180*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_040_mgi:60-820]]
Hurt yourself
*105181*
[[S:::1200-1500]]
on that one, brother?
*105182*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_040_mgi_a:60-1690]]
Hurt yourself on that one, brother?
*105183*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_050_mdi:110-2281]]
Don’t overexert yourself, brother!
*105184*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_060_mdi:30-3250]]
Magni, managing to eke out a decent strike!
*105185*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_070_mgi:40-1000]]
Mine was better.
*105186*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_070_mgi_a:30-1000]]
Mine was better.
*105187*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_080_mgi:0-2240]]
Inferior in every way, Modi.
*105188*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_090_mgi:40-1750]]
Try hitting him, Brother.
*105189*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_100_mgi:104-1987]]
You’re too predictable, Modi!
*105190*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_110_mgi:1610-3780]]
And you think YOU can handle Mjölnir, brother?
*105191*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_120_mgi:85-3465]]
If you won’t take this seriously, Modi, go back to Asgard!
*105192*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_130_mgi:30-2750]]
If father saw that he would pummel you!
*105193*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_140_mdi:0-1130]]
Mjölnir’s gonna be mine!
*105194*
[[S:::1840-3250]]
Might let you polish it though.
*105195*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_150_mdi:61-3519]]
I think even the skinny little twerp hits harder than you, brother.
*105196*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_160_mdi:40-2750]]
That weak shit is just gonna piss him off, Magni.
*105197*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_170_mdi:40-3000]]
Father’s probably watching and laughing at you right now.
*105198*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_180_mdi:30-1920]]
Are you even trying to hurt him?
*105199*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_190_mdi:40-1500]]
Having some trouble over there?
*105200*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_200_mdi:180-2210]]
Hahaha, he got you on that one!
*105201*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_210_mdi:50-2160]]
Try using your brain for once, brother!
*105202*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_220_mdi:0-2500]]
Too eager for daddy’s approval, Magni?
*105203*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_230_mdi:85-1925]]
He’s toying with you, brother!
*105204*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_240_mgi:0-1500]]
Keep talking, fat ass.
*105205*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_250_mgi:30-2000]]
You know dad thinks you’re a joke, right?
*105206*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_260_mgi:0-1210]]
As usual—

Hard living in my shadow, brother?

[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_270_mgi_a:0-2000]]
Hard living in my shadow, brother?

[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_280_mgi:0-2250]]
Still waiting for you to do something.
*105213*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_290_mdi:270-2000]]
Kiss my fat ass, Magni.
*105214*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_300_mdi:0-1250]]
You say something, jackass?
*105215*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_310_mdi:40-940]]
You still here?
*105216*
[[S:::1340-2750]]
Thought I was by myself.
*105217*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_320_mdi:60-1750]]
Too dumb to know when I’m winning, huh?
*105218*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_330_mdi:92-1486]]
Jealous?
*105219*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_340_mgi:95-2763]]
Too much for you, brother?
*105220*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_350_mgi:1010-2000]]
I’LL handle it.
*105221*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_360_mgi:0-1910]]
You let them get the upper hand?
*105222*
[[S:::2700-3250]]
Pitiful.
*105223*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_370_mgi:110-2000]]
Father would be disappointed, Modi.
*105224*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_380_mgi:50-2210]]
A shameful display, Modi.
*105225*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_390_mgi:73-1908]]
Modi, quit fucking around!
*105226*

Modi, you idiot!
*105227*

I’m disappointed, brother.
*105228*
[[S:MAGNI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_420_mgi:20-1650]]
A weak showing, brother.

You losing your touch, brother?
*105230*

I guess I’LL handle it.
*105231*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_450_mdi:210-2290]]
Father would be so disappointed.
*105232*

Magni, you moron!
*105233*

No, don’t get up Magni. I’ll take care of them.
*105234*
[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s294b_480_mdi:45-1496]]
I don’t need him anyway!

Focus, boy! Use your ears.

Looks like they need another lesson, brother.

Oh, I’m more than happy to teach, brother.

I almost felt that.

[[S:MODI:vo_lvl_smc01_s304_200_mdi:430-3250]]
Whoah! Someone taught this runt how to fight.

Nice moves kid!

Gonna carve a trophy out of ya.

Weak and pathetic…

Your daddy must be ashamed, kid.

Gonna take that axe to father.

I’m gonna take that axe to father.

Wisdom…

not one of my strong points.

Wow, kid…

[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s330_010_mmr:270-1400]]
We should keep an eye on him.

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s340_010_kra:60-300]]
Enough?
*105457*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s340_020_mmr:120-660]]
Should do.
*105458*
[[S:::1230-5410]]
With that, we can carve the travel rune to Jötunheim—get you where you need to go.
*105459*
[[S:::6140-9997]]
Incidentally, all those magically-sealed doors we’ve seen can now be unlocked…
*105460*
[[S:::10132-11400]]
like that one around the corner.
*105461*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s340_030_mmr:0-2250]]
You can get through that door there, now that you got the chisel.
*105462*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s355_010_son:0-1675]]
You… killed Magni.
*105463*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s355_020_mmr:71-1076]]
That he did.
*105464*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s355_030_son:18-2490]]
He was a god… but you killed him.
*105465*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s355_040_mmr:40-2250]]
Minor Aesir, perhaps, but aye…
*105466*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s355_050_son:17-1317]]
And his father is Thor…
*105467*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s355_060_mmr:100-720]]
Not Minor.
*105468*
[[S:::1270-2910]]
Not Minor at all, him.
*105469*
[[S:::3750-6250]]
This will not go over well in Asgard.
*105470*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s355_070_kra:150-2150]]
I defended us. Nothing more.

I fear no judgement.
*105472*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s355_080_mmr:70-1500]]
Judgement, no,
*105473*
[[S:::2040-3750]]
but if vengeance is any concern…
*105474*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s355_090_son:0-3044]]

Hey…

Magni didn’t come back to life.

[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_smc01_s357_020_mmr:20-1679]]
That is interesting.
*105492*
[[S:::2360-4949]]
It’s known the Aesir find their own way to Valhalla.

[[S:::5168-8392]]
No Valkyrie escort, no processing at the gates of Helheim.

That may be significant…

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s390_010_son:0-1856]]
Look—we’re back near the giant’s hand.
*105496*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s390_010_son_a:14-1955]]
Look—we’re back near the giant’s hand.
*105497*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s390_020_son:8-381]]
What…
*105498*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s390_030_son:940-1750]]
… what is this place?
*105499*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s390_030_son_a:8-1021]]
… what is this place?
*105500*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s390_040_mmr:0-4050]]
Fishermen would bring the day’s catch into this port and use that contraption to send some of it
*105501*
[[S:::4050-5890]]
directly to the jarl’s main kitchen.
*105502*
[[S:::6490-8000]]
The rest were sorted and sold.
*105503*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s390_050_kra:0-1590]]
There is an exit under the thumb.
*105504*
[[S:::2030-3000]]
Find a way across.
*105505*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s400_010_son:0-602]]
It’s moving.
*105506*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s400_020_son:1-1390]]
(coughs)
*105507*
[[S:::2050-3682]]
Maybe we… can reach it.
*105508*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s410_010_kra:0-890]]
There is an opening.
*105509*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s410_020_son:0-500]]
I can get it.
*105510*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s420_010_son:0-440]]
Oh no… 
*105511*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s420_020_son:0-1790]]
It’s moving back.
*105512*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s420_020_son_a:2-809]]
It’s moving back.
*105513*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s420_030_son:2-814]]
I think that did it.
*105514*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s420_040_son:10-2033]]
There’s a rope up here. (coughs)
*105515*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s420_050_son:3-2298]]
There’s a path to the exit… on the other side.
*105516*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s430_010_mmr:0-960]]
Back under his palm.
*105517*
[[S:::1520-2250]]
We’re almost there.
*105518*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s435_010_son:0-1097]]
Everything we just did…
*105519*
[[S:::1580-2823]]
climbed around a dead giant,
*105520*
[[S:::3160-4503]]
rode a giant falling hammer,
*105521*
[[S:::4840-7669]]
fought some bad gods. What do you think mother would say?
*105522*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc01_s435_020_kra:40-1500]]
That you have come a long way.
*105523*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc01_s435_030_son:3-440]]
Thanks.
*105524*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s350_010_mmr:0-4794]]
Hidden inside that tablet is a mystical rune that creates the magical seal keeping that door locked.
*105525*
[[S:::5044-9317]]
Use our chisel to find the binding points of the hidden rune so we can dispel it.
*105526*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s350_020_mmr:0-1960]]
Hover the chisel over the face of the tablet.
*105527*
[[S:::2310-4750]]
When you’ve found the hidden rune, you’ll feel something.
*105528*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s350_030_mmr:0-800]]
Trouble finding it?
*105529*
[[S:::1250-2250]]
Keep trying then.
*105530*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s350_040_mmr:8-3953]]
You’ll feel a mystical pulse when the hidden rune senses the chisel over it.
*105531*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s350_050_mmr:0-1960]]
You found it. Now dispel it!
*105532*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s350_060_mmr:32-1959]]
That’s it, brother! Dispel it!
*105533*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s350_070_mmr:0-1450]]
Aaaaand you’ve lost it.
*105534*
[[S:::1920-2750]]
Try again, brother.
*105535*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s350_080_mmr:70-1190]]
You almost had it.
*105536*
[[S:::1550-2150]]
Keep looking…
*105537*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc01_s350_090_mmr:0-3010]]
Now the mystical rune’s been dispelled and the seal broken.
*105538*
[[S:::3650-5750]]
You just used the magic of the Giants!
*105539*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsm1_s010_010_son:2-743]]
Thor killed him.
*105540*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsm1_s010_020_son:0-460]]
Oh, no…
*105541*
[[S:::1230-2120]]
he fell on a village?
*105542*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsm1_s010_030_mmr:0-470]]
Aye.
*105543*
[[S:::1240-5920]]
When Thamur fell, he crushed a charming place famed for worshipping the Vanir god, Njörd.
*105544*
[[S:::6610-8740]]
Thor always took credit for planning that one,
*105545*
[[S:::9210-11500]]
but the truth is the sweaty bawbag just got lucky.
*105549*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s490_010_brk_stem:1780-3702]]
Who’s activated the bridge?
*105550*
[[S:::3800-6149]]
Hey! I asked you a question—
*105551*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s490_010_bld_stem:11120-12538]]
Too late,
*105552*
[[S:::12600-14382]]
it’s locked in.
*105553*
[[S:::16390-21320]]
And when the bridge opens, the full weight of Asgard will come crashing down on you.
*105554*
[[S:::24473-25856]]
It’s over.
*105555*
[[S:::47315-50772]]
Let go of him now or I will kill him. You know I will.
*105556*
[[S:::56780-59299]]
What did you do…?
*105557*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s490_010_kra_stem:26000-26872]]
Is it?
*105558*
[[S:::34928-35883]]
So be it.
*105559*
[[S:::43803-45873]]
NO! Listen to me!
*105560*
[[S:::61411-62297]]
BOY!!
*105561*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s490_010_son_stem:43031-43803]]
BALDUR!
*105562*
[[S:::46312-47315]]
Let me help!
*105563*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s510_010_kra_stem:1670-2340]]
Can you make it?
*105564*
[[S:::146100-148032]]
We have work to do.
*105565*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s510_010_brk_stem:5038-6374]]
Is it a weapon?
*105566*
[[S:::7118-12848]]
Armour? Or likewise an instrument of war of which I’m a master at shapin’?
*105567*
[[S:::13378-14103]]
No?
*105568*
[[S:::14327-15706]]
Then forget it.
*105569*
[[S:::15826-18962]]
Even if I wanted to make such an insignificant gewgaw,
*105570*
[[S:::19177-24295]]
I’m liable to chink my tools working on something so delicate and ladylike.
*105571*
[[S:::30677-32425]]
Okay, smart guy.
*105572*
[[S:::32550-36454]]
And where d’ya propose to find a lump of quality skap slag?
*105573*
[[S:::36466-40288]]
Last time I saw one, I could still get rigid down south.
*105574*
[[S:::42562-48187]]
Shut your mouth. Is that…? Where did you…?
*105575*
[[S:::52632-58100]]
(laughter) Well, don’t just stand there—let’s do this!
*105576*
[[S:::63168-65587]]
Ah hell… why not?
*105577*
[[S:::66612-69986]]
What? I can grow too…
*105578*
[[S:::75535-79403]]
YOU keep your wrist loose. I need more heat here!
*105579*
[[S:::82100-86838]]
I don’t need to—I triple-quenched it with Draugr oil. See?
*105580*
[[S:::96632-97900]]
No, it's not!
*105581*
[[S:::102100-104145]]
Nope! Don’t forget this!
*105582*
[[S:::119856-124136]]
Oh, quit yer grinning. It’s downright unsettlin’ hrmm.
*105583*
[[S:::130450-134646]]
Yeah, price of uh.. reforging something what broke.
*105584*
[[S:::137300-140813]]
Oh, cut it out, princess. You’re gonna get me all weepy.
*105585*
[[S:::157237-159699]]
Ohhhh…
*105586*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s510_010_sin_stem:23985-25000]]
Then shingle it.
*105587*
[[S:::25900-29950]]
Pattern weld the item with skap slag. Keep the layers thin, alternate the overlay.
*105588*
[[S:::48610-53100]]
I had to get my hands dirty. (gags)
*105589*
[[S:::58240-61910]]
What? You? You’re fine with working on something that’s not a weapon?
*105590*
[[S:::72010-73660]]
Oh, Watch the spine.
*105591*
[[S:::74160-75100]]
Keep your wrist loose.
*105592*
[[S:::79405-79900]]
Coming up.
*105593*
[[S:::80460-82030]]
You going to temper that steel longer?
*105594*
[[S:::86900-88879]]
Oh, how inventive. And sanitary!
*105595*
[[S:::90532-95810]]
You clever little beaver! Never too late to learn a new trick, is it?
*105596*
[[S:::101215-102000]]
Here it is!
*105597*
[[S:::141625-145300]]
I like the new one better, don’t you?
*105598*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s510_010_son_stem:124427-126530]]
It’s just nice to see you together.
*105599*
[[S:::127458-128190]]
But…
*105600*
[[S:::128432-130439]]
now the rune on your brand looks different.
*105601*
[[S:::134211-135632]]
I knew it.
*105602*
[[S:::135681-137200]]
You two love each other.
*105603*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s515_010_kra_stem:4616-5360]]
Boy,
*105604*
[[S:::5660-6280]]
your knife.
*105605*
[[S:::22040-23720]]
Some sort of travel stone.
*105606*
[[S:::34510-35200]]
You know it?
*105607*
[[S:::46290-47300]]
He held this.
*105608*
[[S:::48720-50350]]
In the panel in Odin’s library.
*105609*
[[S:::70550-72871]]
The Realm Between Realms…
*105610*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s515_010_son_stem:9881-10411]]
Dreifa.
*105611*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s515_010_mmr_stem:19260-21120]]
Well? What’ve we got?
*105612*
[[S:::24890-25730]]
Let me see…
*105613*
[[S:::30230-31620]]
Great Auðumbla’s udders—
*105614*
[[S:::32010-33570]]
that’s the Unity Stone!
*105615*
[[S:::35800-37680]]
I wasn’t sure it existed!
*105616*
[[S:::38280-39760]]
If Týr possessed this,
*105617*
[[S:::40160-44250]]
that explains how he could visit all the realms, and other lands, to boot.
*105618*
[[S:::50990-51660]]
Yes…
*105619*
[[S:::53140-56320]]
Yes! That’s it—I understand now.
*105620*
[[S:::56850-60120]]
It shows Týr walking the Realm Between Realms.
*105621*
[[S:::60630-62680]]
You know how you must never stray from the path?
*105622*
[[S:::63190-63490]]
Well,
*105623*
[[S:::63970-67400]]
Týr always followed his own path, if you catch my meaning.
*105624*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s520_010_mmr_stem:17230-24940]]
Thooooor stuh-tooooo… eeeee-kneeeee smooooo-thooooo thooooor-fah.
*105625*
[[S:::32780-33720]]
Ohhhh.
*105626*
[[S:::38190-41114]]
Uhh, he thinks it might still be in his stomach.
*105627*
[[S:::41447-46490]]
Um… and he’s open to letting you row into his mouth to look inside.
*105628*
[[S:::51560-54750]]
By the by, he’s not wild about it either.
*105629*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s520_010_spt_stem:26190-32600]]
Skeeeeel-yaaaaah. Pvooooo-meeeee-thooooor…
*105630*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s520_010_kra_stem:36210-37690]]
Is the statue lost to us?
*105631*
[[S:::57357-58902]]
Mmmh…
*105632*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl12_s520_010_son_stem:48627-49570]]
Ew,
*105633*
[[S:::50070-50864]]
really?
*105634*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl12_s010_001_son:160-1150]]
There it is! We’ve got it!
*105635*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl12_s010_002_mmr:100-2680]]
Ha! I guess the Temple was made to be flipped.
*105636*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl12_s010_010_son:130-1750]]
Look, the tree’s upside down!
*105637*
[[S:::2240-3620]]
Or… are we?
*105638*
[[S:::4100-5000]]
I’m not sure anymore.
*105639*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl12_s020_010_son:107-3467]]
So you’re saying Týr’s shrine was showing him stepping off the branch of the world tree.
*105640*
[[S:::4013-8449]]
And you’re thinking, to reach the secret path to Jötunheim, that’s what we need to do?
*105641*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl12_s020_020_kra:80-874]]
I am.
*105642*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl12_s020_030_mmr:100-1034]]
Oh, dear.
*105643*
[[S:::1300-3050]]
That is what you’re thinking, isn’t it?
*105644*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl12_s030_010_son:40-420]]
Good.
*105645*
[[S:::960-4710]]
I am more than okay with not throwing ourselves over the edge of the World Tree just yet.
*105646*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl12_s030_020_kra:50-1000]]
In due time, boy.
*105647*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl12_s030_030_mmr:50-490]]
Uh…
*105648*
[[S:::867-1361]]
really?
*105649*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl12_s030_030_mmr_a:41-517]]
Uh…
*105650*
[[S:::830-1474]]
really?
*105651*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s492_010_kra_stem:3440-5570]]
You will LISTEN to me and not speak a word.
*105652*
[[S:::6230-9470]]
I am your father—and you, boy, are not yourself.
*105653*
[[S:::10110-14550]]
You are too quick to temper. You are rash, insubordinate, and out of control.
*105654*
[[S:::15320-16840]]
This will not stand.
*105655*
[[S:::17790-21250]]
You will honour your mother and abandon this path you have chosen.
*105656*
[[S:::23220-24220]]
It is not too late…
*105657*
[[S:::27930-29580]]
This discussion is far from over.
*105658*
[[S:::30600-32550]]
We are here because of you, boy.
*105659*
[[S:::34360-35350]]
Never forget that.
*105660*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s494_010_pbld_stem:280-4740]]
No… no, I would never have wanted this!
*105661*
[[S:::5970-7720]]
You…you had no right.
*105662*
[[S:::10440-12220]]
You had no RIGHT, Witch!!
*105663*
[[S:::13670-18530]]
I can’t taste. I can’t smell. I can’t even feel the temperature of this…this room.
*105664*
[[S:::19570-24930]]
Feasting…drinking…women. It’s all gone. Gone!
*105665*
[[S:::32080-38620]]
Than never feel again? Yes. YES! I would rather die.
*105666*
[[S:::39710-45100]]
Take it away, mother. Please…please, please, take it away.
*105667*
[[S:::46110-47240]]
Oh please…(crying)
*105668*
[[S:::63710-64300]]
No…
*105669*
[[S:::66670-67180]]
I won’t.
*105670*
[[S:::72650-73920]]
You ruined my life.
*105671*
[[S:::78030-78490]]
NO!
*105672*
[[S:::83160-85670]]
No, not If you can’t fix it, Mother.
*105673*
[[S:::89100-90030]]
Come on.
*105674*
[[S:::94540-95540]]
COME ON!
*105675*
[[S:::120400-122310]]
I never want to see you again.
*105676*
[[S:::125820-126680]]
Never.
*105677*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s494_010_fre_stem:7740-10520]]
I had every right. I am your mother.
*105678*
[[S:::23470-27010]]
But you will never have to feel pain again.
*105679*
[[S:::27690-31950]]
Death has no power over you now. You would rather die?
*105680*
[[S:::40860-41510]]
… I can’t.
*105681*
[[S:::44960-48500]]
It doesn’t work like that, Son.
*105682*
[[S:::49480-53030]]
Trust me in time you will thank me.
*105683*
[[S:::55310-56660]]
You will thank me.
*105684*
[[S:::74090-78050]]
Honey, we can figure this out. I promise, trust me, I know how —
*105685*
[[S:::90850-91550]]
Son—
*105686*
[[S:::95530-96050]]
Son—
*105687*
[[S:::130030-131030]]
(crying)
*105688*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s494_010_bld_stem:38710-39360]]
Yes.
*105689*
[[S:::56060-56510]]
C’mon.
*105690*
[[S:::65430-66050]]
Yes.
*105691*
[[S:::69000-69500]]
C'mon,
*105692*
[[S:::71350-71790]]
c'mon.
*105693*
[[S:::90540-91600]]
Do it. DO IT!
*105694*
[[S:::92380-92830]]
Do it.
*105695*
[[S:::110220-111180]]
Coward!
*105696*
[[S:::142950-145040]]
What you did to me…
*105697*
[[S:::146880-151250]]
WHAT YOU DID TO ME!! (screams and yells)
*105698*
[[S:::164020-175690]]
(crying) I’m a coward… I’m a… I’m a coward. I’m a worth.. worthless coward (continued crying)
*105699*
[[S:::196290-203580]]
(crying) I’m a coward… I’m a, I’m a worth, worthless coward…(continued crying)
*105700*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s495a_010_kra_stem:3120-3810]]
Atreus.
*105701*
[[S:::7040-7750]]
Together now.
*105702*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s495a_010_son_stem:5600-6553]]
I can help?
*105704*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s495b_010_son_stem:7430-9626]]
We did it. We’re free.
*105705*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s499_010_son_stem:3244-6192]]
Look at that! It’s the missing panel, about Týr.
*105706*
[[S:::8387-11243]]
Odin must have stolen it. But why?
*105707*
[[S:::22205-24077]]
Why? What does it mean?
*105708*
[[S:::41834-43383]]
What are those runes in the corners?
*105709*
[[S:::50744-51712]]
How do you…?
*105710*
[[S:::57523-58342]]
Oh.
*105711*
[[S:::88322-89355]]
What is that!?
*105712*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s499_010_mmr_stem:11599-15443]]
He always has his reasons. Might I have a look?
*105713*
[[S:::18662-21605]]
Well… this is most unexpected.
*105714*
[[S:::24079-26726]]
I haven’t the foggiest. Isn’t that unexpected?
*105715*
[[S:::27778-32918]]
Look, clearly that’s Týr… travelling, somehow, perhaps magically.
*105716*
[[S:::33733-37792]]
But what’s that to do with the Giants, that they should devote a shrine to it?
*105717*
[[S:::38344-41103]]
I’m afraid that is none too clear.
*105718*
[[S:::44042-48306]]
Not runes. Symbols… from different lands. They mean—
*105719*
[[S:::49557-50742]]
Aye.
*105720*
[[S:::67776-71750]]
No doubt signifying the gift of sight the Giants granted us…
*105721*
[[S:::71750-73571]]
Give me a closer look.
*105722*
[[S:::76606-77893]]
Interesting…
*105723*
[[S:::85159-87919]]
Very interesting.
*105724*
[[S:::89574-96564]]
Secret plans, concealed by Týr so none could access but him… and those few others the Giants trusted.
*105725*
[[S:::97081-102543]]
And right under Odin’s nose—ha-ha! I did promise I’d get you to Jötunheim…
*105726*
[[S:::106497-110912]]
Don’t you see, brother? Odin never gave up hope, and neither should we.
*105727*
[[S:::111232-114605]]
He knew there was a clue in here, but we’re the ones who found it.
*105728*
[[S:::114605-118014]]
These plans are for a key to some chamber Týr’s kept hidden.
*105729*
[[S:::118214-122194]]
I don’t know where it’s leading us or what we’ll find… but it’s a path.
*105730*
[[S:::127192-129031]]
I suggest we ask a dwarf.
*105731*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s499_010_kra_stem:26800-27778]]
Head…
*105732*
[[S:::48700-49557]]
War.
*105733*
[[S:::52600-54761]]
This one I know too well.
*105734*
[[S:::62880-63770]]
His eyes.
*105735*
[[S:::64450-65650]]
They are jewels.
*105736*
[[S:::66540-67580]]
Like yours.
*105737*
[[S:::102460-103884]]
What do you mean, head?
*105738*
[[S:::104240-106325]]
You said we were out of options.
*105739*
[[S:::124770-126753]]
How do we make this key?
*105740*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s500_010_kra_stem:6260-7033]]
Boy…
*105741*
[[S:::9040-9906]]
Before…
*105742*
[[S:::10774-11847]]
what you…
*105743*
[[S:::12700-13587]]
saw…
*105744*
[[S:::18920-20695]]
You did not see me with someone?
*105745*
[[S:::21550-22838]]
An old man?
*105746*
[[S:::31710-32467]]
Yes…
*105747*
[[S:::34350-35189]]
very well.
*105748*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s500_010_son_stem:15520-16814]]
I didn’t see anything.
*105749*
[[S:::24070-25067]]
What old man?
*105750*
[[S:::29400-30552]]
Can we go?
*105751*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s498_010_zeu_stem:12800-14370]]
It is time, my son.
*105752*
[[S:::15310-17693]]
Look around at what you have done.
*105753*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s498_010_son_stem:57004-58586]]
Come on. We gotta go.
*105754*
[[S:::60371-61950]]
There’s no time! LOOK!
*105755*
[[S:::77088-78159]]
I have a plan!
*105756*
[[S:::79807-80661]]
JUMP!!
*105757*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s498_010_kra_stem:58700-60065]]
You saw...
*105758*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s498_010_mmr_stem:100610-104074]]
That was your plan? You’re both cracked!
*105760*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s040_010_son_stem:0-1060]]
It was me…
*105761*
[[S:::21476-23516]]
That wasn’t me.
*105762*
[[S:::24548-25604]]
I couldn’t have done that.
*105763*
[[S:::29659-30126]]
Yeah.
*105764*
[[S:::33443-33959]]
Yeah.
*105765*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s040_010_pson_stem:3300-4440]]
But we’re gods.
*105766*
[[S:::5950-9470]]
We can do whatever we want.
*105767*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s040_010_kra_stem:9470-10490]]
Turn away, boy.
*105768*
[[S:::25740-27230]]
Do not dwell on those thoughts.
*105769*
[[S:::27830-28530]]
Not here.
*105770*
[[S:::30970-31950]]
We must keep moving.
*105771*
[[S::vo_lvl_hel02_s040_010_pmdi_stem:10490-12691]]
Hehehehe…
*105772*
[[S:::14107-15807]]
that’s what I said… to your mother…
*105773*
[[S:::16520-18160]]
right before I gave it to her.
*105774*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s010_010_kra:0-600]]
BOY?
*105775*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s010_020_son:0-810]]
I’m here…
*105776*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s010_030_kra:10-949]]
Stay still.
*105777*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s010_040_son:80-1200]]
Are you gonna help me?!
*105778*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s010_060_son:59-1189]]
Hellooooo!
*105779*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s010_050_son:122-1829]]
Nngh. I’m stuck! C’mon!
*105780*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s020_020_mmr:0-1060]]
Not just Hel…
*105781*
[[S:::1420-3170]]
worst place in Hel you could’ve put us.
*105782*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s020_010_son:34-2674]]
Wow, it’s cold. This is Hel?
*105783*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s020_011_son:3-1424]]
I can’t believe we’re back in Hel.
*105784*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s020_030_kra:0-750]]
I see a ship.
*105785*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s020_040_mmr:0-630]]
Get us there.
*105786*
[[S:::1120-3220]]
It only takes us halfway to Týr’s Temple
*105787*
[[S:::3610-5500]]
but at least it gets us far from here.
*105788*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s020_050_mmr:20-3600]]
For a thousand mortal lifetimes, the Bridge Keeper kept the living out of this place.
*105789*
[[S:::4120-6230]]
But now that you’ve ripped his heart out, here we are.
*105790*
[[S:::6810-8250]]
Funny how it all comes around.
*105791*
[[S:PHANTOM SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s040_010_pson:40-1750]]
He should pay for what he said about mother.
*105792*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s040_020_kra:21-673]]
Boy?
*105793*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s040_030_son:0-2265]]
That… wasn’t me.
*105794*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s050_010_kra:0-340]]
Head.
*105795*
[[S:::830-1500]]
What was that?
*105796*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s050_020_mmr:0-3690]]
Not just the old and sick come to Helheim… so do the criminals.
*105797*
[[S:::4330-8250]]
Hel must not draw a distinction between us and those whom these visions are meant to torture.
*105798*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s050_030_kra:0-870]]
How do we stop it?
*105799*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s050_040_mmr:0-1030]]
Escape Hel.
*105800*
[[S:::1430-2500]]
As soon as possible.
*105801*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s050_050_son:40-5854]]
I’m not gonna let it bother me. Like you said, Mimir—it was just an illusion. That wasn’t me.
*105802*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s050_060_kra:0-470]]
No.
*105803*
[[S:::1410-3330]]
But it is who you have become of late.
*105804*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s050_070_son:70-570]]
Look,
*105805*
[[S:::930-2290]]
I know I got us into this.
*105806*
[[S:::2710-3560]]
But I’ll get us out…
*105807*
[[S:::4255-5077]]
whoever I am.
*105808*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s050_080_kra:40-2750]]
*I* will get us out. You will follow orders.
*105809*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s050_090_son:61-1477]]
But maybe that’s not who I am.
*105810*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s050_100_kra:36-3309]]
It had better be. Now let me focus.
*105811*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s060_010_mmr:0-2144]]
I don’t mean to hurry you, but… faster?
*105812*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s060_020_kra:1-820]]
Let me think.
*105813*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s060_030_son:0-660]]
So…
*105814*
[[S:::1170-2750]]
I can’t feel my fingers.
*105815*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s060_031_mmr:0-1750]]
Maybe both wind traps need to be filled?
*105816*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s060_040_mmr:0-2500]]
Those gears up there… could we jam a door open maybe?
*105817*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s060_050_kra:4-693]]
Keep moving.
*105818*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s070_010_son:0-640]]
Wait,
*105819*
[[S:::840-1980]]
I think I see Baldur up ahead…
*105820*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s080_010_kra:12-940]]
Stay out of sight.
*105821*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s080_020_son:1-412]]
Listen…
*105822*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s095_010_kra:0-1450]]
Freya is his mother.
*105823*
[[S:::1840-4000]]
How did that escape your stories, Head?
*105824*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s095_020_kra:0-1350]]
Freya is his mother.
*105825*
[[S:::1950-3500]]
Why did you keep this from us, Head?
*105826*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s095_030_mmr:20-1500]]
Would you believe it slipped m’mind?
*105827*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s095_040_kra:50-750]]
I would not.
*105828*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s095_050_mmr:260-1451]]
I’m at a loss.
*105829*
[[S:::1850-4360]]
I assure you I’ve no reason to keep such a thing a secret.
*105830*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s095_060_kra:70-960]]
There’s the boat.
*105831*
[[S:::1550-3070]]
We will speak more of this.
*105832*
[[S:::3590-4000]]
Soon.
*105833*
[[S:PHANTOM OLD MAN:vo_lvl_hel02_s100_010_zeu:0-1660]]
Such chaos.
*105834*
[[S:::2150-5000]]
I will have much to do after I kill you.
*105835*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s100_020_son:19-698]]
Who was that?
*105836*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s100_030_kra:0-670]]
We must hurry.
*105837*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_010_mmr:0-470]]
Er…
*105838*
[[S:::1020-3230]]
not entirely sure this is seaworthy.
*105839*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_020_kra:0-500]]
She will do.
*105840*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_021_kra:0-3200]]
In that case, we need to sail this boat as far away from here as possible.
*105841*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_030_son:100-2250]]
Can this thing even sail covered in all this bramble?
*105842*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_031_son:0-440]]
Mimir?
*105843*
[[S:::920-2140]]
How’s the fire staying lit?
*105844*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_032_mmr:31-1632]]
Would you believe “magic”?
*105845*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_033_son:0-900]]
Or those blades…
*105846*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_050_son:0-500]]
Now what?
*105847*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_060_kra:0-1250]]
Give me space to work.
*105848*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_080_son:30-620]]
Locked, huh?
*105849*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_100_son:70-790]]
Let me help.
*105850*
[[S:::1510-2130]]
What can I do?
*105851*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_110_kra:70-1000]]
You have done enough.
*105852*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_120_son:59-1184]]
The sails are intact!
*105853*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_130_son:187-800]]
We’re moving!
*105854*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_170_mmr:0-3620]]
Great. Just bear in mind—this boat can only take us part of the way.
*105855*
[[S:::4140-9380]]
Týr’s Temple is near the top of a tremendous waterfall which, sadly, we are downstream.
*105856*
[[S:::9780-11530]]
That means even if we get there intact,
*105857*
[[S:::11950-14744]]
we’d still need to sail UP a waterfall somehow.
*105858*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_180_son:150-3500]]
The Vanir built the greatest ship that ever was and it can fly.
*105859*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_190_mmr:0-970]]
Skíðblaðnir?
*105860*
[[S:::1340-1720]]
Yeh…
*105861*
[[S:::2120-5500]]
because it was designed to fly. This was not.
*105862*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s110_200_kra:0-2370]]
Nevertheless, this is the boat we have.
*105863*
[[S:::2960-3500]]
We make do.
*105864*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_020_son:40-1370]]
Owp! We’re stuck.
*105865*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_030_mmr:0-2250]]
On perhaps the biggest iceberg I’ve ever seen.
*105866*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_030_mmr_a:0-2490]]
On perhaps the biggest iceberg I’ve ever seen.
*105867*
[[S:::3080-4250]]
We are now officially sunk.
*105868*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_031_son:8-1542]]
The whole front of the boat’s blocked!
*105869*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_032_kra:0-1250]]
The bow of the boat.
*105870*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_040_son:80-1410]]
At least the fire’s making heat.
*105871*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_050_son:30-550]]
What now?
*105872*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_060_son:60-1572]]
I’m trying not to be impatient…
*105873*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_070_mmr:51-1212]]
Let your father think.
*105874*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_080_son:30-789]]
You’re chopping it…?
*105875*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_090_mmr:0-1250]]
Give your father room.
*105876*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_100_son:90-1500]]
So now the sails are loose…?
*105877*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_101_kra:0-750]]
Just watch.
*105878*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_110_son:0-1280]]
You cut the sails loose.
*105879*
[[S:::2010-2640]]
So now what?
*105880*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s120_200_son:110-1080]]
You’re pulling the sails down?
*105881*
[[S:::2090-3350]]
But how they gonna catch the wind?
*105882*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s130_010_son:0-3685]]
We’re floating! The heat from the fires! We’re actually floating!
*105883*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s130_020_son:2-1285]]
Aaaaand we’re stuck again.
*105884*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s130_030_kra:0-2000]]
Not for long. Stay with the boat.
*105885*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s130_040_son:3-2636]]
I can’t believe it. You just made a huge sky lantern.
*105886*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s130_050_son:30-1600]]
Our ship’s lodged on this bridge.
*105887*
[[S:::2240-2500]]
Sure I can’t help?
*105888*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s130_060_kra:40-1460]]
I said stay on the boat.
*105889*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s130_070_son:0-1000]]
Staying on the boat…
*105890*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s130_080_son:51-1624]]
The ship’s stuck on this bridge over here!
*105891*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s130_080_son_a:55-1608]]
The ship’s stuck on this bridge over here!
*105892*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s130_090_son:71-1721]]
That did it. We’re loose!
*105893*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s130_100_kra:50-1000]]
Wait for me there!
*105894*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s135_010_son:50-2371]]
Look! Now we’re stuck on this bridge!
*105895*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s132_010_mmr:0-1277]]
We need to talk, brother.
*105896*
[[S:::1910-4060]]
You do realise it’s over, don’t you?
*105897*
[[S:::4860-9840]]
Even if we make it back to Midgard, you and Baldur destroyed the only gate to Jötunheim.
*105898*
[[S:::10030-15825]]
We are out of options. And that boy up there… he’s in nine kinds of pain.
*105899*
[[S:::16164-18107]]
His head’s turned so far around, he—
*105900*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s132_020_kra:290-2249]]
Atreus is not your concern.
*105901*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s132_030_mmr:70-360]]
Well,
*105902*
[[S:::910-3674]]
he might become everyone’s concern if you don’t do something.
*105903*
[[S:::4144-6762]]
You don’t have to be the smartest man in the world to see that.
*105904*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s134_005_son:110-1750]]
We are going to get out of here.
*105905*
[[S:PHANTOM YOUNG KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s134_010_pkra:300-1390]]
Face me, father.
*105906*
[[S:::2110-3750]]
It is time to end this.
*105907*
[[S:PHANTOM OLD MAN:vo_lvl_hel02_s134_020_zeu:0-1360]]
Yes, my son.
*105908*
[[S:::1860-2750]]
It is time.
*105909*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s134_030_kra:6-740]]
No…
*105910*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s134_050_son:0-2789]]
It’s that voice again. Do you know who that is?
*105911*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s134_060_kra:50-2220]]
Head, how long before we reach the temple?
*105912*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s134_070_son:50-1250]]
Yeah, it’s freezing!
*105913*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel02_s134_080_mmr:0-4483]]
As long as we maintain this speed and those fires don’t go out, we should be there in no time, lad.
*105914*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s134_090_son:0-1550]]
How’d you even think to do this, Father?
*105915*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s134_100_kra:1110-1900]]
I… do not know.
*105916*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s134_110_son:0-500]]
Are you okay?
*105917*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s134_120_kra:0-500]]
Yes.
*105918*
[[S:::1210-3450]]
Now stay close to the fire and
*105919*
[[S:::3950-4250]]
rest.
*105920*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s134_130_son:60-350]]
Sir.
*105921*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s140_010_son:3-4316]]
They’re trying to put out the fire! Right-hand side! I mean—starboard!
*105922*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s140_020_son:19-4349]]
They’re trying to put out the fire! Left-hand side! I mean—portside!
*105923*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s140_030_son:0-2226]]
They’re putting out the fire! Starboard!
*105924*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s140_040_son:8-2319]]
They’re dousing the fire! Starboard!
*105925*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s140_050_son:15-2439]]
They’re putting out the fire! Portside!

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s140_060_son:0-2472]]
They’re snuffing out the fire! Portside!
*105927*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s140_070_son:14-1964]]
The fire’s out! Starboard!
*105928*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s140_080_son:20-1885]]
The fire’s out! Portside!
*105929*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s140_090_son:1-1908]]
Hurry! We’re going to flip over!
*105930*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s140_100_son:4-896]]
We’re sinking!!
*105931*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s140_110_son:3-767]]
We’re falling!!
*105932*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s150_010_son:0-1621]]
Iceberg! Portside!
*105933*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s150_020_kra:14-763]]
Hold on!
*105934*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s150_030_son:210-700]]
Iceberg! Starboard!
*105935*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s150_040_son:10-1550]]
Ice knives! Portside!
*105936*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s150_050_son:0-600]]
Ice knives!
*105937*
[[S:::900-1450]]
Starboard!
*105938*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s150_060_son:9-2506]]
Look out! Starboard! More ice!
*105939*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s150_070_son:2-2496]]
Look out! Portside! More ice!
*105940*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s170_010_son:17-2030]]
Something stopped us! Portside!
*105941*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s170_020_son:7-2058]]
Something stopped us! Starboard!
*105942*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s170_030_kra:0-540]]
Harpoon!
*105943*
[[S:::980-2000]]
I will free us!
*105944*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel02_s170_031_mmr:0-3000]]
Brother, the harpoon’s keeping us anchored in place! Free us!
*105945*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s170_040_son:6-759]]
We’re free!
*105946*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s180_010_son:6-1063]]
We’re going to hit that bridge!!
*105947*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s190_010_son:0-3310]]
We’re almost back! Look! Straight ahead. I see it!
*105948*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s190_020_son:4-1001]]
We’re stopped again!
*105949*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s190_030_kra:0-1161]]
Another harpoon!
*105950*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s190_040_kra:0-1000]]
More harpoons!
*105951*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s190_050_son:5-787]]
We’re pitching!
*105952*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel02_s190_051_mmr:0-2190]]
Brother, the bow of the boat’s been harpooned!
*105953*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s190_052_son:7-3542]]
Father, don’t step out onto the bow! It’ll break off!
*105954*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel02_s190_053_mmr:0-1500]]
But we need to lose that harpoon!
*105955*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s190_060_son:13-1474]]
Guess we didn’t need that part of the boat!
*105956*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s190_070_son:40-530]]
Uh…
*105957*
[[S:::870-1970]]
we’re on fire.
*105958*
[[S:::2250-3730]]
The boat is on fire.
*105959*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s190_080_kra:0-500]]
Stay calm.
*105960*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s190_090_son:30-3320]]
I’m not panicking. Just saying the boat is on fire.
*105961*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s200_010_son:2-2333]]
Look there! The temple! We made it!
*105962*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s200_020_son:0-3050]]
Wait. We’re going too fast. We’re going to fly past it!
*105963*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s210_010_kra:0-1300]]
We are leaving this realm.
*105964*
[[S:::1750-2160]]
NOW.
*105965*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s210_020_son:34-1925]]
As long as we didn’t wreck our way back…
*105966*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s220_010_son:13-1147]]
What is this place?
*105967*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s220_020_mmr:70-4000]]
This is Odin’s. I’d recognise his atrocious taste anywhere.
*105968*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_hel02_s220_030_mmr:10-1220]]
Look at all this…
*105969*
[[S:::1810-4750]]
The amount of arcane knowledge hidden between these walls—
*105970*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s220_031_son:38-2240]]
It’s so much bigger than his other libraries!
*105971*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s220_040_kra:0-2500]]
I would rather not be here when Odin returns. Come.
*105972*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s215_010_son:0-2960]]
I think this is where Odin brought all his best clues about Jötunheim!
*105973*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s230_010_son:40-2230]]
I think I know just the door that key goes to.
*105974*
[[S:::3260-4160]]
Down by the water,
*105975*
[[S:::4960-5500]]
remember?
*105976*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s230_020_son:40-1350]]
That symbol on the temple door…
*105977*
[[S:::2020-3240]]
it’s a bunch of runes together.
*105978*
[[S:::4140-4640]]
Peace.
*105979*
[[S:::5110-5660]]
Unity.
*105980*
[[S:::6280-6670]]
Hope,
*105981*
[[S:::7420-8200]]
other things too.
*105982*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s230_030_mmr:40-2960]]
Týr’s own design. He made this door himself.
*105983*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s240_010_mmr:60-3080]]
Alright, let’s get back to Midgard and see about making that key.
*105984*
[[S:::3700-4500]]
Where’s that dwarf?
*105985*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_010_kra:80-1010]]
Now, head—
*105986*
[[S:::1540-4000]]
why did you not tell us Baldur is the son of Freya?
*105987*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_010_kra_a:0-850]]
Now, head—
*105988*
[[S:::1210-3750]]
why did you not tell us Baldur is the son of Freya?
*105989*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_010_kra_b:0-850]]
Now, head—
*105990*
[[S:::1210-3750]]
why did you not tell us Baldur is the son of Freya?
*105991*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_020_mmr:110-1250]]
He IS!
*105992*
[[S:::1690-7800]]
It’s shocking every time I hear it and yet obviously I know it.
*105993*
[[S:::7800-8500]]
But when I think about Baldur and Freya, I…
*105994*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_030_son:35-635]]
Mimir?
*105995*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_040_mmr:100-680]]
Yes, lad?
*105996*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_050_kra:48-2305]]
[chuckle] Freya.
*105997*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_060_mmr:66-973]]
How’s that, brother?
*105998*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_070_kra:70-590]]
Head,
*105999*
[[S:::1350-3000]]
tell me Baldur’s vulnerability.
*106000*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_080_mmr:90-4250]]
Baldur is blessed with invulnerability to all threats, physical or magical.
*106001*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_090_son:0-1250]]
Wait, what is happening?
*106002*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_100_kra:300-2250]]
He is bewitched not to speak of what he knows.
*106003*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_110_mmr:97-5854]]
I am? I AM! That’s it precisely. Ooh… I wonder how long that’s been so—
*106004*
[[S:::6075-10703]]
since she had m’head at her mercy, or back when I figured out Baldur’s weakness.
*106005*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_120_son:61-867]]
Mimir!
*106006*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_130_mmr:47-766]]
Yes, lad?
*106007*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_140_son:50-1828]]
You just said you figured out Baldur’s weakness!
*106008*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_150_mmr:140-730]]
Did I?
*106009*
[[S:::1450-5750]]
But Baldur is blessed with invulnerability to all threats, physical or magical.
*106010*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_160_son:20-910]]
AUGH!
*106011*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_hel02_s250_170_kra:100-500]]
Enough.
*106012*
[[S:::1420-2860]]
This means there is a way.
*106013*
[[S:::3460-4770]]
If he troubles us again,
*106014*
[[S:::5460-6750]]
we will find it.
*106015*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_hel02_s131_010_son:0-3050]]
Wait, what’re you doing up there? The ship’s stuck on this bridge down here!
*106016*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl13_s060_010_son_stem:74-4283]]
Hey, guys. Question for you—anyone know where we can find Mimir’s other eye?
*106017*
[[S:::54128-55377]]
What was the statue?
*106018*
[[S:::66276-68444]]
How are we supposed to look inside the snake?
*106019*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl13_s060_010_sin_stem:5110-5823]]
Oh.
*106020*
[[S:::9627-10231]]
That’s…
*106021*
[[S:::11685-12712]]
I’m sorry.
*106022*
[[S:::13310-16045]]
As a matter of fact, Odin asked me to…
*106023*
[[S:::18560-20276]]
he wanted me to build a…
*106024*
[[S:::22800-24988]]
he showed it to me, you see, and I…
*106025*
[[S:::27330-28030]]
declined.
*106026*
[[S:::28880-29210]]
Sorry,
*106027*
[[S:::29680-30960]]
will you excuse me?
*106028*
[[S:::42366-51157]]
Ah, it’s all over my hands. Is that corn?
*106029*
[[S:::63140-64100]]
Sorry about that.
*106030*
[[S:::64545-65395]]
Feeling much better.
*106031*
[[S:::69804-72138]]
Inside?! OH, no…
*106032*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl13_s060_010_mmr_stem:31570-32910]]
Well, that was useless.
*106033*
[[S:::77600-80759]]
We’d better go see what the World Serpent has to say about that.
*106034*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl13_s060_010_brk_stem:33910-34760]]
You know…
*106035*
[[S:::35256-42525]]
it was about that same time that Odin came around lookin’ for me to build a statue with some sort of hidden compartment.
*106036*
[[S:::43246-50619]]
Now that not being a weapon and the Aesir being a bunch of pock-speckled cockers. I too saw fit to decline.
*106037*
[[S:::50920-53615]]
But I know he got it built just the same.
*106038*
[[S:::56484-60316]]
It’s that one of Thor, out there flashin’ his sac to the lake.
*106039*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl13_s060_010_kra_stem:60870-62500]]
The statue that the serpent ate.
*106040*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s010_010_son:144-676]]
Look,
*106041*
[[S:::1020-1948]]
we’re back in Midgard!
*106042*
[[S:::2610-3359]]
There’s the bridge!
*106043*
[[S:::3939-4504]]
We did it—
*106044*
[[S:::4813-6107]]
the tower’s back where it belongs!
*106045*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s010_020_mmr:120-2054]]
Just when I thought I’d seen it all.
*106046*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s010_020_mmr_a:191-2134]]
Just when I thought I’d seen it all.
*106047*
[[S:::2730-5833]]
Now to the realm travel room and then to Jötunheim.
*106048*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl13_s010_030_kra:160-2857]]
Now Týr’s travel room can take us to Jötunheim.
*106049*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s010_040_son:7-553]]
And look—
*106050*
[[S:::921-3621]]
now we can finally light all the braziers and see what happens!
*106051*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s010_050_son:115-1247]]
How did Týr do this?
*106052*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s010_060_mmr:0-5049]]
Odin suspected the Giants secretly possessed some remnant of primordial Jötnar creative essence—
*106053*
[[S:::5123-6900]]
the stuff all realms were made of.
*106054*
[[S:::7360-10322]]
The Unity stone must have been fashioned from that essence.
*106055*
[[S:::10731-13103]]
To trust an outsider with it, even Týr,
*106056*
[[S:::13347-15194]]
tells you just how desperate they were.
*106057*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s020_010_mmr:140-1468]]
You take a wrong turn, brother?
*106058*
[[S:::1762-3500]]
Realm travel room’s back up top.
*106059*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s020_020_son:140-3132]]
We might have last minute stuff we wanna do before we leave.
*106060*
[[S:::3481-4973]]
Who knows how long we’ll be gone.
*106061*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s020_030_mmr:172-797]]
Fair enough!
*106062*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s030_010_mmr:154-3665]]
I don’t know what we’ll find when we get to Jötunheim, but we must cover our tracks.
*106063*
[[S:::3966-6744]]
Odin’s ravens will tell him of the tower’s restoration,
*106064*
[[S:::7013-9750]]
and we mustn’t let our efforts be to his benefit.
*106065*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl13_s030_020_kra:50-819]]
Very well.
*106066*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_010_son:77-1581]]
This is it. Here we go!
*106067*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_020_mmr:200-2000]]
Hold on, wait a minute… this isn’t going to work.
*106068*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_030_kra:45-436]]
What?
*106069*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_040_mmr:150-1590]]
There’s no travel crystal.
*106070*
[[S:::2150-6500]]
Týr must have used his own eyes to refract the energy. It was his final failsafe.
*106071*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_050_son:62-1571]]
But you’ve got eyes like him, Mimir.
*106072*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_060_mmr:170-2530]]
I’ve got AN eye—one!
*106073*
[[S:::2960-6500]]
Odin plucked out my other eye precisely to keep me from travelling.
*106074*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_070_mmr:180-1090]]
Sorry, lads.
*106075*
[[S:::1590-2500]]
Thought that would work…
*106076*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_080_kra:0-1750]]
What did Odin do with your other eye?
*106077*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_090_mmr:130-970]]
He’d have kept it…
*106078*
[[S:::1430-3060]]
in any of a hundred places, I’m afraid.
*106079*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_100_son:60-2832]]
We’ve come so far. There has to be a way.
*106080*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_110_mmr:90-490]]
Look…
*106081*
[[S:::840-1760]]
bit of a long shot,
*106082*
[[S:::2029-4858]]
but for years I’d see Sindri, sometimes Brok,
*106083*
[[S:::5075-8088]]
lurking around on that mountain when Odin came for his visits.
*106084*
[[S:::8470-10000]]
Maybe they know something?
*106085*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s040_120_son:19-878]]
Brok and Sindri!
*106086*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s050_010_son:0-3100]]
We gotta remember to ask Sindri and Brok about your eye next time we see them.
*106087*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s050_020_mmr:130-1760]]
If they even know anything about it…
*106088*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s065_010_mmr:18-2049]]
Well, lads, I don’t know what lies ahead,
*106089*
[[S:::2372-6079]]
but now would be a good time to make sure your gear is ready for the worst.
*106090*
[[S:::6542-8845]]
Anything you need to do, I’d do it now.
*106091*
[[S:::9351-10563]]
Just some sage advice…
*106092*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s070_010_mmr:0-1250]]
Once more to the horn…
*106093*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s080_010_mmr:22-3064]]
(practicing vocal warm-ups)
*106094*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s080_020_mmr:0-300]]
Ready!
*106095*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s090_010_son:120-1850]]
So… are we really doing this?
*106096*
[[S:::2410-4430]]
Letting the serpent… swallow us?
*106097*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl13_s090_020_kra:40-1000]]
You do not have to come.
*106098*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s090_030_son:56-1736]]
Well, I’m not gonna MISS this…
*106099*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s100_010_son:150-4000]]
I absolutely support this decision to put off getting eaten by the World Serpent.
*106100*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s100_020_son:100-3000]]
I am more than okay rowing away from the giant snake’s mouth…
*106101*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s110_010_son:70-1750]]
You… sure this is a good idea?
*106102*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl13_s110_020_kra:50-588]]
No.
*106103*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s120_010_mmr:0-3640]]
Well, brothers… I’ve been to many strange places… but this will be a new one.
*106104*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s120_020_son:120-4710]]
Heh… yeah, I’ve never been in a Giant’s belly either. How about you, father?
*106105*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl13_s120_030_kra:250-2270]]
Never one that was not trying to eat me.
*106106*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl13_s120_040_mmr:0-2500]]
We really should expect that sort of response at this point.
*106107*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl13_s120_050_son:21-815]]
Here we go…
*106108*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s010_010_son:33-2847]]
We’re inside!  But… what is this place?
*106109*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s010_020_mmr:30-2000]]
Your guess is as good as mine, little brother.
*106110*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s010_030_son:60-750]]
Should I shoot it?
*106111*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s020_010_son:50-5511]]
The tree! We’re underneath the realm travel room! But… why is the floor on the ceiling?
*106112*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s020_020_mmr:60-2500]]
Those realm doors seem to mirror the ones above…
*106113*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s020_030_kra:110-600]]
Keep looking.
*106114*
[[S:::1210-2000]]
There must be more.
*106115*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s040_010_kra:110-640]]
Up there.
*106116*
[[S:::1370-3750]]
Týr used the same magic to protect the Black Rune.
*106117*
[[S:::4430-6050]]
The clue we seek may be inside.
*106118*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s040_020_son:77-2254]]
Hunh—right next to the Jötunheim door!
*106119*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s040_030_mmr:30-1000]]
Interesting…
*106120*
[[S:::1440-2360]]
but can we reach it?
*106121*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s040_040_kra:30-750]]
Not from here.
*106122*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s050_010_mmr:50-550]]
Well!
*106123*
[[S:::950-2700]]
One inner sanctum within another…
*106124*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s050_020_son:20-990]]
Those tapestries…
*106125*
[[S:::2070-3230]]
looks like more Giant art…
*106126*
[[S:::4720-6500]]
Whatever Týr did for them must have been big.
*106127*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s060_010_son:0-1470]]
Whoa. Who are they?
*106128*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s065b_010_son:40-250]]
Ready?
*106129*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s065c_010_kra:40-1250]]
Go on, read.
*106130*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s065c_020_son:80-4477]]
“Before the first, after the last / Nothing between, no shadow cast”
*106131*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s065c_030_mmr:53-2276]]
Hm… Ominous.
*106132*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s065d_010_kra:40-1750]]
Boy—on the statues.
*106133*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s065d_020_son:20-590]]
I see them…
*106134*
[[S:::1170-2000]]
it says “Void.”
*106135*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s065e_010_kra:40-1750]]
Boy—on the statues.
*106136*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s065e_020_son:20-590]]
I see them…
*106137*
[[S:::1170-2000]]
it says “Void.”
*106138*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s065e_030_mmr:30-450]]
Ah—
*106139*
[[S:::900-2146]]
I was going to say “void”…
*106140*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s065f_010_kra:40-1250]]
Go on, read.
*106141*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s065f_020_son:150-4000]]
“Before the first, after the last / Nothing between, no shadow cast”
*106142*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s065f_030_mmr:53-2265]]
Hm… Ominous.
*106143*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s065f_040_kra:31-810]]
Now write.
*106144*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s065f_050_son:57-525]]
Auðr…
*106145*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s065g_010_kra:31-810]]
Now write.
*106146*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s065g_020_son:57-525]]
Auðr…
*106147*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s045_010_son:0-1250]]
Oh! What’s behind there?
*106148*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_010_kra:18-679]]
Hm…
*106149*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_020_kra:60-630]]
Boy…
*106150*
[[S:::1480-2750]]
this is the rune for Jötunheim?
*106151*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_030_son:50-650]]
That’s right…
*106152*
[[S:::1120-1670]]
and look—
*106153*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_040_son:31-1532]]
… we’re on the other side of the door.
*106154*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_050_kra:210-1500]]
The upside-down door…
*106155*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_060_son:30-795]]
What are you thinking?
*106156*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_070_kra:20-750]]
Stand back.
*106157*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_080_son:0-500]]
Ooo-kay.
*106158*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_081_son:38-638]]
It’s moving!
*106159*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_082_mmr:70-750]]
What’s moving?
*106160*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_083_son:30-550]]
Everything!
*106161*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_090_kra:108-2416]]
RAAAAAA!
*106162*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_120_mmr:50-1140]]
Extraordinary.
*106163*
[[S:::1600-3750]]
The whole room is built on some kind of axle.
*106164*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_130_son:36-1100]]
There’s chains on both sides. Without those…
*106165*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_131_kra:1130-2170]]
… we can flip the temple.
*106166*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_132_son:0-610]]
All right!
*106167*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_133_mmr:180-1250]]
Do what now?
*106168*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_140_son:80-580]]
Uh-oh…
*106169*
[[S:::930-1863]]
things are happening…!
*106170*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_150_son:0-437]]
Okay…
*106171*
[[S:::1030-2083]]
I don’t think they’re attacking.
*106172*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_160_kra:43-3093]]
RAAAAAA!
*106173*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_170_mmr:0-3781]]
If you mean to break those chains, I’m afraid you’ll need to go see to it personally.
*106174*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_180_mmr:0-2250]]
Those chains are not apt to break themselves.
*106175*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cltf_s070_190_mmr:0-2750]]
No progress on the chains front as yet, seemingly.
*106176*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s080_010_son:0-1590]]
Oh! Did you know that would spin?
*106177*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s080_020_son:90-1350]]
I think I could hit that crystal…
*106178*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s080_030_son:53-4913]]
Look! The light’s making symbols on the floor. But… something’s not right.
*106179*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s080_040_son:89-2071]]
Something’s shifting. Keep it going….
*106180*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s080_050_son:60-270]]
Ah!
*106181*
[[S:::930-2160]]
It’s the nine realms!
*106182*
[[S:::2640-4000]]
Always about Unity with Týr.
*106183*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s080_060_son:20-1023]]
Hey, what’d you find?
*106184*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s080_070_son:0-1500]]
I… think it’s done all it’s gonna do.
*106185*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s100_050_mmr:80-4250]]
Are you quite sure flipping the temple is the only way to reach the whatever-it-is?
*106186*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s100_060_kra:0-1340]]
You said there would be a path.
*106187*
[[S:::1800-3000]]
The temple can be flipped.
*106188*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s100_070_mmr:80-3750]]
Therefore… we flip the temple. The logic is unassailable…
*106189*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s105_010_mmr:40-5982]]
Hm… not sure what happens when we recklessly upend a room that’s rooted to eight other realms.
*106190*
[[S:::5982-10200]]
I’m curious, of course… but it’s a leap to imagine it gets us to Jötunheim.
*106191*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s105_020_son:36-984]]
I don’t mind a leap.
*106192*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s105_030_mmr:70-3500]]
Well… who knows—perhaps you and Týr are the same kind of mad.
*106193*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s105_040_son:98-1343]]
Hey, look at that!
*106194*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s105_070_kra:70-3000]]
There… where the chains meet. We must find a way around.
*106195*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s105_080_kra:30-2915]]
An army… of statues?
*106196*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s105_080_kra_a:50-700]]
An army…
*106197*
[[S:::1360-2500]]
of statues?
*106198*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s105_090_mmr:20-4498]]
I don’t think they’re the kind that come to life, if that’s what you’re worried about.
*106199*
[[S:::3337-8445]]
Týr often said in the world of peace he envisioned, the only soldiers he’d need would be statues.
*106200*
[[S:::8896-12116]]
Bless his heart, but the bugger did take himself rather seriously, didn’t he?
*106201*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s110_010_mmr:32-1854]]
Again with the death traps!
*106202*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s110_020_son:50-1100]]
See you on the other side.
*106203*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s110_030_mmr:27-3721]]
I had a thought, brother… why don’t you let the lad carry me for a while?
*106204*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s110_040_kra:70-1410]]
And let you miss this?
*106205*
[[S:::2130-2500]]
No.
*106206*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s110_050_mmr:60-1970]]
You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?
*106207*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s110_060_kra:22-471]]
Hnn.
*106208*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s140_010_son:85-1450]]
The chain! We made it!
*106209*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s140_020_mmr:50-1850]]
Time to do what you do, brother.
*106210*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s143_010_son:110-2000]]
“Until gods grow good”
*106211*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cltf_s143_020_mmr:20-1250]]
Could be quite a wait.
*106212*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s143_030_son:60-490]]
Nah—
*106213*
[[S:::1390-2500]]
they’re just waiting for us.
*106214*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s146_010_son:160-1750]]
“Leave them in Peace”
*106215*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cltf_s146_020_mmr:30-2000]]
Obviously not referring to us…
*106216*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s150_009_son:33-503]]
Look out!
*106217*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s150_010_kra:100-550]]
Come.
*106218*
[[S:::1060-2000]]
The other chain waits.
*106219*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s170_010_kra:740-1300]]
RAAAAAA!
*106220*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s170_020_mmr:0-1750]]
Going to have to break both chains, I’m afraid.
*106221*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s170_030_kra:26-1191]]
Obviously.
*106222*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s170_040_kra:43-3093]]
RAAAAAA!
*106223*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cltf_s170_050_mmr:69-3049]]
I’m fairly sure it’s on the side you didn’t go before.
*106224*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s170_060_kra:0-650]]
Head…
*106225*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s170_070_kra:2180-2450]]
RAAAAAA!
*106226*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cltf_s170_080_mmr:30-1500]]
I’m biting my tongue.
*106227*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s180_010_mmr:20-3500]]
Ah, it’s the other kind. Variety is so important.
*106228*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s180_020_son:0-1730]]
Gettin’ pretty good at crawling into holes,
*106229*
[[S:::2190-2500]]
anyway…
*106230*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s180_030_mmr:70-1750]]
I truly do hate this part…
*106231*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s180_040_kra:20-974]]
I know.
*106232*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s200_010_son:56-2035]]
I can’t believe we’re so close!
*106233*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s200_020_mmr:20-1220]]
I, for one, never doubted.
*106234*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s200_030_son:0-400]]
Right.
*106235*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s210_010_kra:110-800]]
Boy?
*106236*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s210_020_son:0-550]]
Yessir?
*106237*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s210_030_kra:0-1250]]
Time to flip the temple.
*106238*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s210_040_son:30-610]]
Yes SIR!
*106239*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s210_050_mmr:0-2650]]
Let’s just agree to stop saying “flip the temple”—
*106240*
[[S:::3000-4500]]
it’s starting to sound normal.
*106241*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s220_010_mmr:44-5678]]
Brothers… I know what I promised, but in case this doesn’t work, just remember—Týr had good cause to create these obstacles.
*106242*
[[S:::7310-11496]]
He’s kept Jötunheim out of Odin’s reach, but the world is hardly at peace.
*106243*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s220_020_son:49-5575]]
No… but it’s got hope. We’re all working together now… we have unity. That’s what the rune on the
*106244*
[[S:::5575-8676]]
door to this place was telling us. We’re on Týr’s path.
*106245*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s230_010_mmr:30-1450]]
Lift with your legs, brother.
*106246*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s230_020_son:0-900]]
He knows.
*106247*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s230_020_son_a:40-900]]
He knows.
*106248*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s230_030_mmr:70-1250]]
Just trying to be helpful.
*106249*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s230_040_kra:1310-4078]]
RAAAAAA!
*106250*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s230_050_mmr:40-1480]]
Bloody outstanding!
*106251*
[[S:::2010-6110]]
On the day that brute force is the answer, I’ll be quite happy to be on your side, brother.
*106252*
[[S:::6375-8446]]
And we’re not dead—that’s a plus.
*106253*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s230_060_son:63-1444]]
There—on the left…
*106254*
[[S:::1686-4261]]
I think we can climb back up to the Realm Travel Room from there!
*106255*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s230_070_mmr:60-2452]]
Oh! He’s right, you know—I see it too.
*106256*
[[S:::2779-4800]]
A place to climb up, back where you did the flipping.
*106257*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s230_080_kra:37-2502]]
Mm… a climb, you say?
*106258*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s230_090_mmr:25-1500]]
Aye, by the statues.
*106259*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s240_010_son:21-5196]]
See that, Mimir? Nobody could do all this alone. All these obstacles…
*106260*
[[S:::5380-14145]]
they’re just chances to prove we’re the ones who can beat them. We may argue… me and father, you and Freya, Brok and Sindri…
*106261*
[[S:::15048-20033]]
but when we all work together, we DO make a good team… and that’s Týr’s test.
*106262*
[[S:::20495-22645]]
That’s why we’re gonna make it to Jötunheim.
*106263*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cltf_s240_020_mmr:30-3250]]
Do you hear that, brother? Lad’s found his equilibrium.
*106264*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cltf_s240_030_son:140-1000]]
What’s that mean?
*106265*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cltf_s240_040_kra:0-2190]]
He means you speak wisely, Atreus.
*106266*
[[S:::2910-4250]]
And that is good to hear.
*106267*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl14_s580_010_kra_stem:2310-2880]]
Boy.
*106268*
[[S:::3590-4040]]
The head…
*106269*
[[S:::4770-5440]]
get ready.
*106270*
[[S:::29130-29910]]
Now, boy!
*106271*
[[S:::48020-48970]]
We must be close.
*106272*
[[S:::53510-54350]]
We will see.
*106273*
[[S:::77750-78250]]
True.
*106274*
[[S:::79100-80260]]
But if someone were to find you—
*106275*
[[S:::99550-101996]]
Watch the head ’til we return.
*106276*
[[S:::112659-113869]]
Ready?
*106277*
[[S:::116082-116988]]
Come.
*106278*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl14_s580_010_son_stem:6760-7510]]
Oh, right.
*106279*
[[S:::9225-9715]]
Got him.
*106280*
[[S:::11565-14095]]
Let’s hope this doesn’t cause you to explode or anything.
*106281*
[[S:::18623-20323]]
Nah. I’m sure you’ll be fine.
*106282*
[[S:::21051-21744]]
Ready!
*106283*
[[S:::41707-42234]]
Look.
*106284*
[[S:::49853-53371]]
Well… what are we waiting for? You think it’s far?
*106285*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl14_s580_010_mmr_stem:14060-18446]]
Oh. Hadn’t considered that. Maybe we should talk about this a bit more.
*106286*
[[S:::23477-25753]]
Oop—that’s unpleasant!
*106287*
[[S:::63390-65923]]
A word, please, before we continue…
*106288*
[[S:::69021-73445]]
Listen… the last thing you two need up there’s a decomposing head ruining the moment.
*106289*
[[S:::73747-75553]]
Why don’t I wait for you here?
*106290*
[[S:::75761-77817]]
This is between you and the boy.
*106291*
[[S:::93391-97524]]
Oh-no, no, no.
*106292*
[[S:::97716-99762]]
Fine, damn it, FINE.
*106293*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl14_s580_010_brk_stem:80000-83150]]
By Lady Sif’s soft, perfect sloshers!
*106294*
[[S:::83820-85601]]
You done did it!
*106295*
[[S:::108488-110428]]
Okay?
*106296*
[[S::vo_lvl_cl14_s580_010_sin_stem:86430-87385]]
Sorry.
*106297*
[[S:::87580-89056]]
We had to see this.
*106298*
[[S:::103070-103700]]
I can do this.
*106299*
[[S:::104390-105705]]
No… No, I can’t.
*106300*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl14_s010_010_son:2-2672]]
Here we go! I can’t believe we’re gonna see the Giants.
*106301*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl14_s010_020_mmr:110-2250]]
Well, if things work according to plan… (clears throat)
*106302*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl14_s020_010_mmr:120-2750]]
Brother, the way to Jötunheim’s back in the Realm Travel Room.
*106303*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl14_s020_020_kra:140-3090]]
We do not know what resistance we will face when we return.
*106304*
[[S:::4040-6250]]
Best to conclude our outstanding business now.
*106305*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl14_s020_030_mmr:120-1000]]
Reasonable enough…
*106306*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl14_s030_010_mmr:140-2621]]
Go ahead and lock in Jötunheim and we’ll be on our way.
*106307*
[[S:::3283-3832]]
Probably.
*106308*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl14_s040_010_brk:0-2250]]
Boy, do I have plans for you.
*106309*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl14_s040_020_mmr:140-1750]]
Do hurry back! Please?!
*106310*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_cl14_s040_030_brk:0-2250]]
Don’t flatter yourself, goat-boy.
*106311*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl14_s005_010_son:120-1700]]
Why did Baldur say we cost him?
*106312*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl14_s005_020_mmr:100-5000]]
Odin must have convinced him that following you to Jötunheim would bring his cure. Lies, I’m sure.
*106313*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl14_s005_030_son:100-1940]]
Why did Mistletoe break the spell?
*106314*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl14_s005_040_mmr:120-6056]]
Vanir magic is powerful, but its rules are slippery and elusive. I’m sure it makes sense if you’re
*106315*
[[S:::6056-11872]]
a witch. Oh, but it’s all so bloody tragic… Baldur was the greatest gift Odin granted Freya; the
*106316*
[[S:::11872-17688]]
one thing she treasured from their marriage. She only hoped to spare him pain, and spare herself
*106317*
[[S:::17688-22425]]
loss—but such impulses can lead good parents to make terribly stupid decisions.
*106318*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s015_010_son:44-2109]]
Funny… I used to dream about getting eaten.
*106319*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clsb_s015_020_kra:50-1000]]
Dreams are nothing to f—
*106320*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s015_030_son:40-3988]]
I’m not afraid. It just reminded me of a way I used to feel. When I was a child.
*106321*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s015_040_son:37-954]]
Let’s find that statue.
*106322*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s040_010_son:52-4196]]
Ouch… the water kind of burns in here. That is water, isn’t it?
*106323*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s040_020_mmr:118-2129]]
Aye… most of it…
*106324*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s045_010_mmr:32-4302]]
Huh. Smell’s not as bad as I thought it’d be. A bit like heather ale fermenting. 
*106325*
[[S:::4751-6508]]
Rather pleasant, actually.
*106326*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s045_020_son:0-920]]
You’re so weird.
*106327*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clsb_s050_010_kra:40-1362]]
There—the hammer.
*106328*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s050_020_son:0-470]]
Mimir…
*106329*
[[S:::840-2387]]
any idea where Odin hid your eye?
*106330*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s050_030_mmr:30-600]]
No.
*106331*
[[S:::1000-2630]]
It’s not like I can still see through it.
*106332*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s060_010_mmr:20-1250]]
Maybe if that was closer….
*106333*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s060_020_mmr:40-1000]]
Not gonna make that…
*106334*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s060_030_mmr:50-1590]]
We’re not reaching that platform…
*106335*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s060_040_son:74-2011]]
Mm… didn’t say where we could reach it…
*106336*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s060_050_son:39-1035]]
Freeze it there and we’re good!
*106337*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s060_060_son:20-412]]
Why…?
*106338*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s060_070_son:37-1566]]
I don’t think that ever got close enough.
*106339*
[[S:::1979-2777]]
But I feel like it could.
*106340*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s060_080_son:19-723]]
Forget something?
*106341*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clsb_s070_010_kra:22-1171]]
Something inside…
*106342*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s070_020_son:0-350]]
Yep.
*106343*
[[S:::810-1250]]
That’s an eye.
*106344*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s070_030_mmr:40-1500]]
Gently now, gently…
*106345*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s070_040_mmr:0-2640]]
Maybe you should stick that in my head for safe keeping.
*106346*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s070_050_mmr:40-910]]
Thank you, brother.
*106347*
[[S:::1430-3750]]
You don’t miss depth until it’s gone.
*106348*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s080_010_son:0-854]]
How’s it feel, Mimir?
*106349*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s080_020_mmr:28-3948]]
Well, I wouldn’t say I’m feeling whole again, but it’s a right improvement.
*106350*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clsb_s080_030_kra:50-1368]]
The Bifröst is intact?
*106351*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s080_040_mmr:65-1069]]
It’ll serve.
*106352*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clsb_s080_050_kra:60-1509]]
Then we have all we need.
*106353*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s080_060_son:63-3555]]
Finally, we’re going to Jötunheim. There’s no stopping us now.
*106354*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s080_070_mmr:60-2750]]
Laddy, have you ever heard the term “tempting fate”..?
*106355*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s080_080_son:0-2000]]
Fate is another lie told by the gods.
*106356*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s080_090_mmr:20-1520]]
… told by the gods, yes, of course.
*106357*
[[S:::2060-4000]]
You really are your father’s son, you know.
*106358*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s080_090_mmr_a:80-4500]]
… told by the gods, yes, of course. You really are your father’s son, you know.
*106359*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_010_son:0-1184]]
So how do we get back out?
*106360*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_020_kra:40-766]]
We signal the—
*106361*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_030_mmr:22-786]]
What’s going on?!
*106362*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_040_kra:28-762]]
Hold on.
*106363*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_041_mmr:40-5285]]
Well that was mildly terrifying. Maybe our presence is upsetting Jormungandr’s belly?
*106364*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_042_kra:0-420]]
No.
*106365*
[[S:::1010-2000]]
Something is wrong.
*106366*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_050_son:23-880]]
What’s happening to him?!
*106367*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_051_mmr:22-764]]
Nothing good!
*106368*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_60_mmr:17-986]]
Glad that’s over.
*106369*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_110_son:51-1843]]
Is he getting hit? What is that?
*106370*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_111_kra:30-750]]
We must hurry.
*106371*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_112_mmr:21-1344]]
Couldn’t agree more, brother.
*106372*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_120_kra:0-1750]]
Hold tight and watch your balance!
*106373*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_130_mmr:15-1474]]
The boat’s shifting! I’m gonna—
*106374*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clsb_s090_140_kra:44-775]]
I have you!
*106375*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s540_010_kra_stem:22110-23659]]
Boy?
*106376*
[[S:::23659-25095]]
BOY!
*106377*
[[S:::38136-39250]]
No.
*106378*
[[S:::39370-40895]]
Something else…
*106379*
[[S:::43340-44260]]
The dead giant…
*106380*
[[S:::47380-49868]]
why would the serpent leave us here?
*106381*
[[S:::67930-71077]]
Until we know for certain… keep your distance.
*106382*
[[S:::76710-78635]]
You are far from home.
*106383*
[[S:::86514-88313]]
You do not know where he is then?
*106384*
[[S:::215204-223522]]
This path you walk… vengeance. You will find no peace. I know.
*106385*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s540_010_son_stem:25186-28778]]
Pffah—! I’m good...
*106386*
[[S:::29274-30741]]
Think I’m getting kind of used to this.
*106387*
[[S:::34095-36984]]
What happened to him? Something we did?
*106388*
[[S:::52030-52895]]
Look.
*106389*
[[S:::63282-67258]]
Freya. We can still trust her... right?
*106390*
[[S:::74873-76142]]
We hoped you would know.
*106391*
[[S:::99407-100591]]
When'd you see him last?
*106392*
[[S:::116666-117427]]
There!
*106393*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s540_010_fre_stem:70660-72532]]
The World Serpent…
*106394*
[[S:::72610-74259]]
what's happened here?
*106395*
[[S:::78640-80419]]
I’m looking for my son.
*106396*
[[S:::80880-82429]]
The two of you…
*106397*
[[S:::83430-85735]]
you helped me see things more clearly.
*106398*
[[S:::88390-89543]]
No.
*106399*
[[S:::89860-93132]]
But the woods and fields speak his name.
*106400*
[[S:::93190-95331]]
I know he walks here in Midgard.
*106401*
[[S:::101780-103343]]
Long ago…
*106402*
[[S:::103770-106009]]
before you were even born.
*106403*
[[S:::107110-109604]]
Why are you standing so far from me?
*106404*
[[S:::111210-112741]]
What’s wrong?
*106405*
[[S:::113750-115566]]
Something’s happened…
*106406*
[[S:::144995-146351]]
My boy…
*106407*
[[S:::155734-157162]]
I’m here.
*106408*
[[S:::157162-159037]]
Don’t run away.
*106409*
[[S:::167024-169193]]
I know that you’re still angry.
*106410*
[[S:::169193-173364]]
I know that how you feel hasn’t changed, but I want you to—
*106411*
[[S:::211552-214192]]
No! Back off, Kratos. This has nothing to do—
*106412*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s540_010_bld_stem:125524-132866]]
I had a feeling hurting the big snake would bring the two of you out in the open.
*106413*
[[S:::132960-137425]]
Do you have any idea, any idea at all,
*106414*
[[S:::137490-140114]]
what you have cost me?
*106415*
[[S:::152720-154366]]
Mother?
*106416*
[[S:::162246-166100]]
Oh, I’m not going anywhere, mother.
*106417*
[[S:::173525-175449]]
How I feel?
*106418*
[[S:::176163-177774]]
How I feel?!
*106419*
[[S:::182182-188365]]
I spent the last one hundred years dreaming of this moment.
*106420*
[[S:::188536-193605]]
I’ve rehearsed everything I ever wanted to say to you, every word,
*106421*
[[S:::193615-198317]]
to make you understand exactly what you stole from me.
*106422*
[[S:::201819-209198]]
But now I realise… I don’t need you to understand anything.
*106423*
[[S:::209198-211552]]
I don’t need you at all.
*106424*
[[S:::226386-234494]]
You… I’ll deal with you later. But family first.
*106425*
[[S:::244751-246423]]
This again.
*106426*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s550_010_bld_stem:10439-12916]]
You might want to turn away, boy.
*106427*
[[S:::13420-15162]]
This won’t be pretty.
*106428*
[[S:::18991-19993]]
Fine.
*106429*
[[S:::41843-43934]]
What is this?
*106430*
[[S:::49250-51637]]
I can feel this...
*106431*
[[S:::58211-60811]]
I can feel everything!
*106432*
[[S:::79089-82706]]
No! Mother!
*106433*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s550_010_son_stem:16407-17349]]
I won’t let you hurt him.
*106434*
[[S:::32814-34366]]
Not… my blood…
*106435*
[[S:::67347-69342]]
He’s— vulnerable now?
*106436*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s550_010_kra_stem:17332-18483]]
No, boy…
*106437*
[[S:::19990-20630]]
STOP!!!
*106438*
[[S:::21260-22120]]
NO!!
*106439*
[[S:::23040-23420]]
No…
*106440*
[[S:::23840-24440]]
Atreus…
*106441*
[[S:::25370-25960]]
you’re bleeding.
*106442*
[[S:::26830-27410]]
Breathe, boy…
*106443*
[[S:::27910-28300]]
breathe!
*106444*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s550_010_fre_stem:62139-64149]]
NO!!
*106445*
[[S:::86106-88148]]
YOU WILL NOT DO THIS!!!
*106446*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s570_010_bld_stem:3685-5250]]
Come on…
*106447*
[[S:::7888-9619]]
do it.
*106448*
[[S:::50496-54591]]
You can’t help yourself,
*106449*
[[S:::55708-57030]]
can you mother?
*106450*
[[S:::58530-60222]]
No matter what
*106451*
[[S:::60222-62027]]
what I do or say,
*106452*
[[S:::62680-63874]]
you won’t
*106453*
[[S:::64962-70220]]
you won’t stop interfering in my life.
*106454*
[[S:::91014-92973]]
No.
*106455*
[[S:::94320-95250]]
No.
*106456*
[[S:::97073-98401]]
We can’t.
*106457*
[[S:::100106-103357]]
Because I will never forgive you.
*106458*
[[S:::106252-111613]]
You still need to pay for the lifetime that you stole from me.
*106459*
[[S:::145257-146530]]
I know.
*106460*
[[S:::175279-178688]]
Why… why do you even care? You
*106461*
[[S:::178688-181351]]
You could have… walked away.
*106462*
[[S:::196195-198101]]
Snow…
*106463*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s570_010_fre_stem:9719-12132]]
Stop… please
*106464*
[[S:::27705-29698]]
I don’t need your protection.
*106465*
[[S:::70220-72717]]
I was just trying to protect you.
*106466*
[[S:::72717-73662]]
I was…
*106467*
[[S:::78980-80020]]
I’ve made mistakes,
*106468*
[[S:::80570-81210]]
I know…
*106469*
[[S:::82370-83720]]
but you’re free now.
*106470*
[[S:::84520-86070]]
You have what you want.
*106471*
[[S:::87460-90590]]
Try to find forgiveness, and we can build something new.
*106472*
[[S:::111740-112710]]
I have
*106473*
[[S:::113070-114007]]
paid…
*106474*
[[S:::115579-117228]]
I have paid.
*106475*
[[S:::123524-126914]]
But if that alone will make you whole…
*106476*
[[S:::129592-133297]]
if seeing me dead will make things right…
*106477*
[[S:::135647-137108]]
I won’t stop you.
*106478*
[[S:::164403-165796]]
I love you…
*106479*
[[S:::204220-208246]]
No, no, no, no, no. no. no… My boy… my dear, sweet, boy…
*106480*
[[S:::222202-227096]]
I will rain down every agony,
*106481*
[[S:::227925-232105]]
every violation imaginable, upon you.
*106482*
[[S:::233455-236630]]
I will parade your cold body
*106483*
[[S:::237278-238766]]
from every corner
*106484*
[[S:::239046-240616]]
of every realm,
*106485*
[[S:::240890-245187]]
and feed your soul to the vilest filth in Hel.
*106486*
[[S:::245187-247274]]
That is my promise.
*106487*
[[S:::248861-251137]]
He robbed me of everything!
*106488*
[[S:::256453-258575]]
everything!
*106489*
[[S:::264245-265869]]
You are just an animal…
*106490*
[[S:::267709-271700]]
passing on your cruelty and rage. You will never change.
*106491*
[[S:::275509-277074]]
I know enough.
*106492*
[[S:::279186-280342]]
Does he?
*106493*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s570_010_son_stem:15490-16518]]
He’s beaten, father…
*106494*
[[S:::17600-18609]]
not a threat.
*106495*
[[S:::157370-159214]]
What?
No! Father…
*106496*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s570_010_kra_stem:22120-24065]]
You will not come for us again.
*106497*
[[S:::25220-27024]]
You will not touch her.
*106498*
[[S:::181550-183599]]
The cycle ends here.
*106499*
[[S:::183790-186182]]
We must be better than this.
*106500*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s570_020_kra_stem:11390-12712]]
Freya…
*106501*
[[S:::13700-15527]]
He chose this.
*106502*
[[S:::69170-71394]]
Then you do not know me.
*106503*
[[S:::83911-84965]]
Boy,
*106504*
[[S:::86466-87722]]
listen close:
*106505*
[[S:::90098-92226]]
I am from a land called Sparta.
*106506*
[[S:::94010-97334]]
I made a deal with a god that cost me my soul.
*106507*
[[S:::99025-101151]]
I killed many who were deserving…
*106508*
[[S:::104102-105989]]
and many who were not.
*106509*
[[S:::116052-118366]]
I killed my father.
*106510*
[[S:::138740-139904]]
No.
*106511*
[[S:::141382-144180]]
We will be the gods we choose to be,
*106512*
[[S:::145188-147250]]
not those who have been.
*106513*
[[S:::148974-152769]]
Who I was is not who you will be.
*106514*
[[S:::154645-156118]]
We must be better.
*106515*
[[S:::175021-179172]]
In her eyes, yes. But she could never make that choice.
*106516*
[[S:::185423-188398]]
We should finish this journey while I still have strength.
*106517*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s570_020_son_stem:43850-45210]]
He saved your life!
*106518*
[[S:::119765-121495]]
That was your father in Hel…
*106519*
[[S:::125174-126920]]
Is this what it is to be a god?
*106520*
[[S:::129498-130884]]
Is this how it always ends?
*106521*
[[S:::133148-135011]]
Sons killing their mothers…
*106522*
[[S:::135898-137922]]
their fathers?
*106523*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s570_020_mmr_stem:171660-172672]]
Well…
*106524*
[[S:::172760-174594]]
guess we’re the bad guys now.
*106525*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s111_010_son_stem:9160-11774]]
Look! I have an idea!
*106526*
[[S:::11774-14864]]
Mooooog-taaaaaaay-oooooom!
*106527*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s111_010_kra_stem:15590-16130]]
Boy?
*106528*
[[S:::19230-20000]]
Well done, boy!
*106529*
[[S::vo_lvl_smc02_s111_010_fre_stem:252-1582]]
Frjósa!
*106530*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc02_s005_010_son:40-1774]]
You have to go—please!
*106531*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_smc02_s005_020_fre:40-1950]]
Fine. But I won’t go far.
*106532*
[[S:::2490-3550]]
I can reach him!
*106533*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_smc02_s005_030_fre:0-2070]]
No! I can reach him!
*106534*
[[S:::2540-4500]]
You have to stop fighting!
*106535*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_010_son:107-2658]]
What’s going on?!? Is Freya trying to kill us?
*106536*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_020_kra:0-460]]
No.
*106537*
[[S:::950-1920]]
Do you hear the wind?
*106538*
[[S:::2430-3250]]
We are moving.
*106539*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_030_son:110-652]]
That arrow…
*106540*
[[S:::1427-2195]]
Baldur punched…
*106541*
[[S:::2711-3528]]
the mistletoe…?
*106542*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_040_kra:0-1770]]
In the quiver’s strap, yes.
*106543*
[[S:::2200-3750]]
Mistletoe harmed him?
*106544*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_040_kra_a:0-1770]]
In the quiver’s strap, yes.
*106545*
[[S:::2230-3680]]
Mistletoe harmed him?
*106546*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_050_son:40-1250]]
Freya said it was wicked…
*106547*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_060_mmr:0-2500]]
He’s more than harmed—the spell is broken!
*106548*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_070_kra:4-1238]]
He can be killed?
*106549*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_080_mmr:0-1130]]
I’m certain of it.
*106550*
[[S:::1880-3500]]
It’s all coming back now…
*106551*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_090_son:40-1000]]
NOW he remembers!
*106552*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_100_son:50-1484]]
Look, there she is!
*106553*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_110_son:20-1400]]
She’s controlling that thing??
*106554*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_120_fre:0-2800]]
Stay out of it! I can reason with him.
*106555*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_130_kra:30-760]]
No, woman!
*106556*
[[S:::1140-1820]]
You cannot.
*106557*
[[S:::2270-3250]]
He means to kill you!
*106558*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_120_fre_a:0-2750]]
Stay out of it! I can reason with him.
*106559*
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_140_bld:60-2923]]
You can’t stop me.
*106560*
[[S:::3290-5155]]
NO ONE CAN.
*106561*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_150_son:0-660]]
Where is he?
*106562*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_160_fre:0-3430]]
I don’t care if he kills me. I WILL protect him.
*106563*
[[S:::3950-6250]]
I WILL NOT LET HIM DIE!
*106564*
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_170_bld:11-1714]]
How touching…
*106565*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_180_fre:57-1580]]
Don’t do this, Kratos…
*106566*
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_smc02_s500_190_bld:1192-2356]]
Ha!
*106567*
[[S:::2600-5838]]
You truly are deluded, Mother.
*106568*

[[S:::2549-4238]]
You don’t have to do this!
*106755*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc02_s090_060_son:19-519]]
There!
*106756*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc02_s090_070_kra:0-840]]
Stop him!
*106764*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_smc02_s100_010_fre:47-3041]]
Please… there has been enough pain.
*106765*
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_smc02_s100_020_bld:2130-2780]]
Shut
*106766*
[[S:::3340-4000]]
UP, MOTHER!
*106767*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_smc02_s100_030_fre:41-1804]]
You don’t want to do this!
*106768*
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_smc02_s100_040_bld:0-1500]]
You don’t know what I want!
*106769*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_smc02_s100_050_fre:0-300]]
No!
*106770*
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_smc02_s100_051_bld:6-2112]]
(maniacal laughter)
*106771*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc02_s100_060_kra:128-653]]
Hrnn!
*106772*
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_smc02_s100_070_bld:0-300]]
Gyahh!

[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_smc02_s100_080_fre:580-1450]]
NOO!!

Get… offa him!
*106776*
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_smc02_s100_100_bld:2410-9480]]
Before you die, I want to thank you. Both of you. You’ve done what even the Allfather himself could
*106777*
[[S:::9480-10010]]
not.
*106778*
[[S:::10360-12650]]
I’ve never felt more alive!
*106779*
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_smc02_s100_110_bld:10-6057]]
Ironic, isn’t it?
*106780*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc02_s100_120_kra:60-550]]
GRYYAHHH!
*106781*
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_smc02_s100_130_bld:10-740]]
What?!
*106782*
[[S:::2380-2750]]
NO!
*106787*
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_smc02_s110_010_bld:100-530]]
WHY
*106788*
[[S:::900-2781]]
WON’T YOU DIE!
*106789*
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_smc02_s110_020_bld:12-2509]]
YOU WON’T STOP ME!
*106790*
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_smc02_s110_030_bld:0-2680]]
I WILL SLAUGHTER YOU BOTH!

YOU THINK YOU CAN BEAT ME NOW?!
*106792*
[[S:BALDUR:vo_lvl_smc02_s110_050_bld:0-2250]]
YOU THINK YOU CAN STOP ME?!
*106793*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_smc02_s110_051_fre:58-3469]]
PLEASE! All of you! You must stop!
*106794*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_smc02_s110_060_fre:0-1740]]
Son! My magick…
*106795*
[[S:::2110-5950]]
I couldn’t let you die! You HAVE to understand!
*106796*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_smc02_s110_070_fre:60-4753]]
NO, Kratos! PLEASE. I need you to stop!
*106797*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_smc02_s110_080_fre:18-4745]]
Atreus—child! Help me stop them! PLEASE!
*106798*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_smc02_s110_090_fre:45-2056]]
Why won’t you listen to me?!?
*106799*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_smc02_s110_100_fre:30-2650]]
It doesn’t have to end this way!
*106800*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc02_s120_041_son:30-5645]]
I don’t understand… I know saving her was the right thing, but she seemed all evil at the end.
*106801*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc02_s120_042_mmr:0-870]]
Not evil.
*106802*
[[S:::1560-3660]]
You killed her son, lad.
*106803*
[[S:::4100-5030]]
Her son.
*106804*
[[S:::5870-9000]]
The death of a child is not something a parent gets over easily.
*106805*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc02_s120_043_son:7-982]]
But he was gonna kill her!
*106806*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc02_s120_044_kra:0-1860]]
She would have died to see him live.
*106807*
[[S:::2460-4250]]
Only a parent can understand.
*106808*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_smc02_s120_045_son:0-1428]]
So you’d let me kill you?
*106809*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc02_s120_046_kra:40-1410]]
If it meant you would live…
*106810*
[[S:::2280-2750]]
yes.
*106811*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc02_s120_047_mmr:0-2590]]
Look, there was no easy choice,
*106812*
[[S:::3100-4290]]
for anybody, brother.
*106813*
[[S:::5070-7780]]
But I think we can all agree you did the right thing.
*106814*
[[S:::8450-10710]]
The world’s a better place with Freya in it.
*106815*
[[S:::11090-11480]]
Just…
*106816*
[[S:::12260-13750]]
give her time, lads.
*106817*
[[S:::14083-15019]]
She’ll come around.
*106818*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_smc02_s120_050_kra:30-1520]]
Back to Týr’s temple then.
*106819*
[[S:::2150-3000]]
One last time.
*106820*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_smc02_s120_060_mmr:0-460]]
Aye…
*106821*
[[S:::970-2287]]
Jötunheim awaits!
*106825*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl15_s010_010_mmr:140-1850]]
Lads! Am I glad to see you.
*106826*
[[S:::2230-4750]]
I believe I’ve reached my limit for Dwarven charm.
*106827*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl15_s010_020_son:62-945]]
What happened, Mimir?
*106828*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl15_s010_030_mmr:130-3920]]
They took an uncomfortable number of measurements, and then proceeded to bicker about the weather.
*106829*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_cl15_s010_040_son:87-1106]]
Where do you want us to take you?
*106830*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl15_s010_050_mmr:110-3000]]
How about the warm confines of anywhere-bloody-else?
*106831*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl15_s020_010_mmr:0-2270]]
Before we return to Midgard, I should warn you…
*106832*
[[S:::2770-8030]]
more time has passed than you likely realise. And the snowfall that began when you slew Baldur…
*106833*
[[S:::8460-10000]]
it’s become something else—
*106834*
[[S:::10510-12000]]
the stuff of omens.
*106835*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl15_s020_020_kra:120-2250]]
Omens? For the coming of winter?
*106836*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl15_s020_030_mmr:110-1140]]
Not just any winter,
*106837*
[[S:::1560-3970]]
but a great winter to span three summers—
*106838*
[[S:::4630-5540]]
and when it’s done,
*106839*
[[S:::6340-7250]]
Ragnarök begins.
*106840*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl15_s020_040_kra:0-700]]
Ragnarök.
*106841*
[[S:::1300-1750]]
From snow.
*106842*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_cl15_s020_050_mmr:0-6140]]
Aye. Snow, lots more snow, and then the end of the bloody world, in that approximate order.
*106843*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_cl15_s020_060_kra:20-1250]]
Another prophecy…
*106844*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_cl15_s020_070_mmr:13-6018]]
No, brother….Prophecy doesn’t expect this for a hundred more winters at least. You’ve changed something.
*106845*
[[S:::6309-8040]]
Prophecy didn’t count on you.
*106846*
[[S::vo_lvl_jtn_s590_010_son_stem:567-7613]]
Look… we’re on the Giant’s Fingers. I can see the highest peak ahead—right over there.
*106847*
[[S:::12558-13113]]
We did it.
*106848*
[[S:::41558-42264]]
What are you doing?
*106849*
[[S:::63343-66573]]
Can we go? We’re so close!
*106850*
[[S::vo_lvl_jtn_s590_010_kra_stem:16830-17998]]
We did.
*106851*
[[S:::44731-47936]]
I have nothing more to hide.
*106852*
[[S:::69804-70833]]
Boy...
*106853*
[[S:::87810-88725]]
Carry her.
*106854*
[[S::vo_lvl_jtn_s600_010_son_stem:8980-9360]]
Wait!
*106855*
[[S:::9900-10480]]
Father...
*106856*
[[S:::11400-12500]]
something’s happening...
*106857*
[[S:::28350-29346]]
It’s your axe...
*106858*
[[S:::30980-31836]]
It’s mother...
*106859*
[[S:::33530-33980]]
Look...
*106860*
[[S:::35860-37640]]
she’s arguing with a bunch of Giants.
*106861*
[[S:::39450-40190]]
She...
*106862*
[[S:::41110-42114]]
knew Giants?
*106863*
[[S:::48417-49549]]
That’s us...
*106864*
[[S:::50840-52669]]
the first time we met the World Serpent.
*106865*
[[S:::54003-54720]]
But how...?
*106866*
[[S:::57704-59064]]
And our fight with Baldur...
*106867*
[[S:::60939-62504]]
But that just happened.
*106868*
[[S:::63998-64829]]
Wait—
*106869*
[[S:::66649-68740]]
they knew everything that was going to happen.
*106870*
[[S:::70854-74361]]
The dragon in the mountain, the Stone Mason...
*106871*
[[S:::76199-77483]]
All these drawings...
*106872*
[[S:::79880-81303]]
this is our story.
*106873*
[[S:::89681-90414]]
But...
*106874*
[[S:::91841-92854]]
what does it all mean?
*106875*
[[S:::101708-102725]]
You didn’t know...
*106876*
[[S:::105550-106567]]
She was a Giant...
*106877*
[[S:::113843-115560]]
I’m a Giant.
*106878*
[[S:::120475-121637]]
Why didn’t she tell us?
*106879*
[[S:::130587-133423]]
But why not just tell us the truth?
*106880*
[[S:::149967-151003]]
If she had a plan for us...
*106881*
[[S:::152040-152939]]
I trust it.
*106882*
[[S:::154256-154877]]
Whatever it is.
*106883*
[[S:::156750-157372]]
Besides...
*106884*
[[S:::159386-160427]]
she hasn’t been wrong yet.
*106885*
[[S:::162441-163067]]
Come on,
*106886*
[[S:::164666-165987]]
we’re so close to the end now.
*106887*
[[S::vo_lvl_jtn_s600_010_kra_stem:81836-82813]]
No...
*106888*
[[S:::85160-86410]]
This is your story.
*106889*
[[S:::93170-95760]]
That I was not the only parent with secrets...
*106890*
[[S:::125460-128674]]
She sent us here knowing we would find this.
*106891*
[[S:::133680-135350]]
Your mother would have had good reasons.
*106892*
[[S:::139790-141890]]
Baldur was never sent to find me.
*106893*
[[S:::143073-145364]]
He was tracking her all along...
*106894*
[[S:::146020-147847]]
not knowing she was only ashes.
*106895*
[[S:::169387-170559]]
Yes...
*106896*
[[S:::173270-175114]]
Yes, we are.
*106897*
[[S::vo_lvl_jtn_s610_010_son_stem:18387-19380]]
Father?
*106898*
[[S:::94621-95795]]
I love you, mom.
*106899*
[[S:::98200-99362]]
The giants…
*106900*
[[S:::101049-102742]]
They really are all gone.
*106901*
[[S:::104535-106045]]
There’s nothing for us here…
*106902*
[[S:::117046-123507]]
So… I get that mother was a Giant. Which makes me part Giant and part God.
*106903*
[[S:::125453-129620]]
Right. I guess there’s just one thing I don’t understand…
*106904*
[[S:::132483-133834]]
My name on the wall—
*106905*
[[S:::135975-137714]]
The Giants called me
*106906*
[[S:::138291-139467]]
“Loki”?
*106907*
[[S:::154337-155352]]
But— why?
*106908*
[[S::vo_lvl_jtn_s610_010_kra_stem:19800-20602]]
No.
*106909*
[[S:::21500-22510]]
We do it together,
*106910*
[[S:::24670-25330]]
son.
*106911*
[[S:::92421-93799]]
Goodbye, Faye.
*106912*
[[S:::109750-110473]]
Come.
*106913*
[[S:::123360-124919]]
And part mortal.
*106914*
[[S:::142951-144445]]
Loki?
*106915*
[[S:::145989-152759]]
That was the name your mother wanted for you when you were born. She must have called you that to her people.
*106916*
[[S:::157811-162680]]
A question for another day. Let us go home.
*106917*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s015_010_son:28-548]]
Hm…
*106918*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s015_020_kra:15-512]]
Boy?
*106919*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s015_030_son:11-3072]]
It’s nothing… I just thought I’d hear voices by now.
*106920*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s010_010_son:40-1200]]
Look! Do you see that?
*106921*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s010_020_kra:0-650]]
See what?
*106922*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s010_030_son:0-1100]]
I’m not sure…
*106923*
[[S:::1460-3630]]
I think I see giants. No…
*106924*
[[S:::4360-5220]]
dead giants.
*106925*
[[S:::5850-7190]]
This realm feels strange.
*106926*
[[S:::7680-8390]]
It’s too quiet.
*106927*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s020_040_son:20-1750]]
Hello? Anybody here?
*106928*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s030_010_kra:40-1250]]
What is this place?
*106929*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s030_020_son:60-3250]]
They must have all come through here when they left Midgard. What was left of them.
*106930*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s040_010_kra:0-1250]]
Why carve all these faces?
*106931*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s040_020_son:0-2690]]
What if this is all of the Giants that got out of Midgard alive?
*106932*
[[S:::3210-4210]]
Not really many at all…
*106933*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s050_010_kra:50-1000]]
Where are they now?
*106934*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s050_020_son:97-4002]]
The Giants came back home so they could survive. But I’m not sure they did.
*106936*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s060_010_son:70-3236]]
I should feel them… but I don’t. This place is dead.
*106937*
[[S:::4069-6549]]
What happened to them? Why’d Mom send us here?
*106938*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s060_020_kra:0-2750]]
One question is answered and two more take its place…
*106939*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s070_010_son:0-2430]]
Odin and Thor… ruining everything for everybody…
*106940*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s080_020_son:33-1486]]
Hunh… who’s the “guardian”…?
*106941*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s102_010_son:60-640]]
Look…
*106942*
[[S:::1530-2360]]
it’s mother’s.
*106943*
[[S:::2950-3910]]
She was here.
*106944*
[[S:::4760-6890]]
She saw every step we took before we took it.
*106945*
[[S:::7990-9290]]
Like she was always with us…
*106946*
[[S:::10360-11500]]
watching over us…
*106947*
[[S:::12480-13250]]
leading us home.
*106948*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s102_020_son:0-750]]
Let’s finish it.
*106949*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s090_010_son:0-4290]]
Guess it all makes sense now. Why she’d want to end up here. Be with her kind.
*106950*
[[S:::5280-9096]]
But… did she know it was going to be like this here? Is this what she wanted us to see?
*106951*
[[S:::10170-13000]]
Did she want us to tell people, or to keep it a secret?
*106952*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s090_020_kra:170-520]]
I…
*106953*
[[S:::1420-2000]]
do not know.
*106954*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s090_030_son:0-750]]
So what should we do?
*106955*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s090_040_kra:0-1750]]
I trust you to decide that.
*106956*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s090_050_son:0-450]]
Oh!
*106957*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s100_010_son:88-4546]]
So… why’d you want to name me Atreus? I know it can’t be for a God.
*106959*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s100_020_kra:50-460]]
Hah.
*106960*
[[S:::1220-1690]]
No.
*106961*
[[S:::2250-3180]]
He was a soldier.
*106962*
[[S:::3600-4250]]
A Spartan.
*106963*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s100_030_son:43-776]]
A great warrior?
*106965*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s100_040_kra:0-1790]]
All Spartans are great warriors.
*106966*
[[S:::2270-3390]]
We train from birth.
*106967*
[[S:::4040-5910]]
Our lives were discipline, duty,
*106968*
[[S:::6420-7720]]
battle, and death.
*106969*
[[S:::8450-11000]]
Life was grim, and we greeted it grimly.
*106970*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s100_050_son:42-515]]
Mm-hmm.
*106971*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s100_060_kra:0-3000]]
But Atreus of Sparta was unlike the rest of us.
*106972*
[[S:::3750-6490]]
He wore a smile even in the worst of times.
*106973*
[[S:::7280-8440]]
He was… happy.
*106974*
[[S:::9590-10970]]
He inspired us to hope…
*106975*
[[S:::11920-13890]]
that though we were machines of war,
*106976*
[[S:::14640-16260]]
yet there was humanity in us.
*106977*
[[S:::17180-17890]]
Goodness.
*106978*
[[S:::18980-21990]]
When the day came for him to lay down his life in battle,
*106979*
[[S:::22830-26840]]
his sacrifice saved countless others, and turned the tide in our favour.
*106980*
[[S:::28320-33090]]
I carried him home on his shield, and buried him with all the honours of Spartan custom.
*106981*
[[S:::34780-37500]]
His memory was a comfort in dark times.
*106982*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s100_070_son:0-2560]]
Wow. You actually told a good story.
*106983*
[[S:::3020-3880]]
Mimir missed it!
*106984*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s110_010_son:240-1800]]
I understand if you want to go home…
*106985*
[[S:::2170-5330]]
but I bet there are still some corrupted Valkyries out there that could be set free.
*106986*
[[S:::6390-7450]]
Some other help people need.
*106987*
[[S:::8180-11210]]
Maybe helping people was part of why Mom sent us out here too.
*106988*
[[S:::12200-12560]]
I mean…
*106989*
[[S:::13130-14420]]
what would Atreus of Sparta do?
*106990*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s110_010_son_a:240-1800]]
I understand if you want to go home…
*106991*
[[S:::2490-2780]]
but…
*106992*
[[S:::3640-6660]]
maybe helping people was part of why Mom sent us out here too.
*106993*
[[S:::7640-8000]]
I mean…
*106994*
[[S:::8590-9870]]
what would Atreus of Sparta do?
*106995*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_jtn_s110_020_kra:50-1250]]
And what would Loki do?
*106996*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_jtn_s110_030_son:68-3839]]
Hunh… that’s a weird name. I’m glad we went with yours.
*106997*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv08_s010_010_son:6-2635]]
Uh… is it a good idea coming back here?
*106998*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv08_s010_020_mmr:0-2860]]
She’s probably in there planning your demise, brother.
*106999*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv08_s010_030_son:0-1550]]
Or bringing Baldur back to life—
*107000*
[[S:::2230-3240]]
like she did you, Mimir.
*107001*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_riv08_s010_040_mmr:20-6208]]
Oh, I’m not alive, lad. I’m reanimated, sure, but make no mistake, I’m still quite dead.
*107002*
[[S:::6684-11311]]
I’ll never be what I once was. She won’t want this for her son, trust me.
*107003*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_riv08_s010_050_son:0-840]]
That’s a relief.
*107004*
[[S:::1660-3500]]
Not the part about you being dead, but,
*107005*
[[S:::4210-4500]]
you know…
*107006*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s200_010_mmr:60-3500]]
If you’re thinking about hurling us all into the void, I hope you’re quite sure.
*107007*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s200_020_son:18-3002]]
Wasn’t it your idea? Find our own path, right?
*107008*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s200_030_mmr:40-500]]
Bollocks…
*107009*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clfin_s202_005_kra:90-3887]]
This is where Týr stepped beyond… and the Unity Stone protected him.
*107010*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clfin_s202_010_kra:30-495]]
Ready?
*107011*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s202_020_son:0-370]]
Ready.
*107012*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s202_030_mmr:0-2979]]
Well… if this is it, lads, it’s been an honour.
*107013*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clfin_s202_040_kra:24-1226]]
Have faith, Head.
*107014*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s202_050_son:50-1646]]
This is incredible!
*107015*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s202_060_mmr:39-3028]]
I… thought… there’d… be… a… bridge…!
*107016*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s210_010_mmr:130-3500]]
Ach… how can I be so nauseous without a stomach?
*107017*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s210_020_son:56-1489]]
Come on, that was great…!
*107018*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clfin_s210_030_kra:47-508]]
Look…
*107019*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s210_040_son:45-2340]]
The tower! I knew there was something down here…
*107020*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s210_050_mmr:80-1290]]
Amazing.
*107021*
[[S:::1710-4050]]
How do you hide something that exists in all realms?
*107022*
[[S:::4600-7060]]
Cast it out of any realm to the space between.
*107023*
[[S:::7560-8750]]
Clever old Týr.
*107024*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s210_051_son:60-1374]]
Is Jötunheim on the other side?
*107025*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s210_052_mmr:130-890]]
Can’t be that.
*107026*
[[S:::1430-4470]]
It’s not like you go through Vanaheim to reach the Midgard peak.
*107027*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clfin_s210_060_kra:60-1250]]
But how do we use it?
*107028*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s210_070_mmr:0-2878]]
I’d suggest we look inside. But stay alert—
*107029*
[[S:::3198-6319]]
Týr’s little challenges are never as simple as they appear.
*107030*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clfin_s210_080_kra:12-1222]]
I have noticed.
*107031*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s220_010_mmr:40-590]]
Well…
*107032*
[[S:::990-2000]]
this is sparse.
*107033*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clfin_s220_020_kra:70-650]]
The pedestal…
*107034*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s220_030_son:90-2134]]
Oh no! It took the stone!
*107035*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s220_040_mmr:28-3414]]
The tower… it’s absorbing the stone’s energy…
*107036*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s220_041_son:36-4160]]
Something’s happening! Is it moving? It’s moving!
*107037*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s220_042_mmr:0-970]]
It knows what to do.
*107038*
[[S:::1580-5000]]
The stone served its purpose. We’re fulfilling Týr’s spell!
*107039*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clfin_s220_050_kra:0-750]]
What happens now?
*107040*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s220_060_mmr:20-960]]
No idea, brother…
*107041*
[[S:::1410-4049]]
but after that fall, I’m sure we’re past the worst of it.
*107042*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s220_070_mmr:44-2308]]
Oop! No, this is considerably worse.
*107043*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s230_010_son:39-1960]]
We’ve stopped… I think it’s over.
*107044*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_clfin_s230_020_mmr:330-560]]
Aye…
*107045*
[[S:::1090-2000]]
but where are we?
*107046*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s225_010_son:0-1670]]
Smells like Niflheim all of a sudden…
*107047*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s225_020_son:0-3559]]
Are we in Niflheim? I knew we should have checked out Niflheim!
*107048*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clfin_s225_030_mmr:40-1750]]
Ugh—glad that’s over…
*107049*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clfin_s225_040_mmr:0-1250]]
Now where are we?
*107050*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s225_050_son:0-1570]]
Oh… looks like Alfheim!
*107051*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s225_060_son:21-3136]]
That was tough… where do you think it’s taking us next?
*107052*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clfin_s225_070_kra:20-1000]]
I do not know.
*107053*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s225_080_son:0-1994]]
Oh no… we’re back in Hel?
*107054*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clfin_s225_090_mmr:27-1454]]
Oh dear, here they come!
*107055*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s225_100_son:0-3011]]
Ogre and Troll at the same time. Sure, that’s fair…
*107056*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_clfin_s225_110_mmr:37-1751]]
Surely that’s enough of that.
*107057*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s225_120_son:15-2231]]
Muspelheim! This won’t be good.
*107058*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clfin_s225_130_son:20-2794]]
Muspelheim? We’ve never been to Muspelheim..!
*107059*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_baldur_fact_finding_010_mmr:71-2490]]
Why don’t you tell me how all this began with Baldur?
*107060*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_baldur_fact_finding_020_son:20-1250]]
He just knocked on our door!
*107061*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_baldur_fact_finding_030_mmr:60-2000]]
Baldur of Asgard just knocked on your door?
*107062*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_baldur_fact_finding_040_son:0-2370]]
Yeah, he just showed up and started a fight.
*107063*
[[S:::3060-4600]]
He said he wanted to know something.
*107064*
[[S:::5529-7622]]
He said “I know what you are”…
*107065*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_baldur_fact_finding_050_kra:16-683]]
Rng.
*107066*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_baldur_fact_finding_060_mmr:90-560]]
Oh!
*107067*
[[S:::920-2620]]
Well, we’ll circle back to that later.
*107068*
[[S:::3140-4750]]
What exactly did he want to know?
*107069*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_baldur_fact_finding_070_son:0-1160]]
I was under the floor by then…
*107070*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_baldur_fact_finding_080_kra:40-2290]]
He said I already knew what he wanted.
*107071*
[[S:::2760-4250]]
Perhaps he mistook me for another.
*107072*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_baldur_fact_finding_090_mmr:84-2252]]
Hm. That’s quite interesting.
*107073*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_inner_light_010_son:50-561]]
Mimir?
*107074*
[[S:::1460-3250]]
Why do you have Bifröst crystals in your eyes?
*107075*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_inner_light_020_mmr:50-2139]]
A loving gift from the Giants.
*107076*
[[S:::2378-4983]]
Since I used to do so much travelling between realms,
*107077*
[[S:::5002-8694]]
they thought it would be more convenient for me than having a crystal I could lose.
*107078*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_inner_light_030_son:30-604]]
Did it hurt?
*107079*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_inner_light_040_mmr:0-5280]]
No, because I wisely fortified myself with sixteen cups of billow maidens’ ale.
*107080*
[[S:::5690-9610]]
Got so inebriated I tried convincing the Giants to put ’em in my nipples instead!
*107081*
[[S:::9824-13063]]
(Laughing)Almost talked them into it too…
*107082*
[[S:::13254-14130]]
Can you imagine?
*107083*
[[S:::14423-17866]]
Mimir of the Bifröst teats!
*107084*
[[S:::17991-19846]]
Those were the days…
*107085*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_inner_light_050_son:41-1011]]
Ewww.
*107086*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_inner_light_060_mmr:900-3269]]
Okay, okay… I’ll stop now.
*107087*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants1_010_son:32-3611]]
So what do you think, Mimir? What does Baldur want with us?
*107088*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants1_010_son_a:32-3611]]
So what do you think, Mimir? What does Baldur want with us?
*107089*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants1_020_mmr:140-1570]]
Well… let’s look at what we know.
*107090*
[[S:::2400-5150]]
Baldur is Odin’s finest tracker, bar none.
*107091*
[[S:::5550-9330]]
If he wants you, you have to consider the possibility that Odin wants you.
*107092*
[[S:::9790-13250]]
And as for what Odin wants, on this I have some expertise.
*107093*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants1_030_son:28-3253]]
What could WE have that Odin doesn’t? He’s like the king of gods!
*107094*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants1_040_mmr:220-1500]]
Of the Aesir, aye,
*107095*
[[S:::1880-3430]]
but his reach is not unlimited.
*107096*
[[S:::3800-6860]]
And where he cannot reach, he is preoccupied with going.
*107097*
[[S:::7300-9750]]
He certainly tortured me enough about it over the years.
*107098*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants2_010_son:49-835]]
So...
*107099*
[[S:::1771-3473]]
Odin wants to go where he can’t reach…
*107100*
[[S:::4423-6292]]
are you saying he’s trying to get to Jötunheim too?
*107101*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants2_020_mmr:110-640]]
Aye,
*107102*
[[S:::1070-3245]]
it ranks among his foremost obsessions.
*107103*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants2_030_son:32-440]]
But…
*107104*
[[S:::1096-2487]]
that doesn’t make any sense, Mimir.
*107105*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants2_040_mmr:90-550]]
Oh?
*107106*
[[S:::930-2408]]
When did I stop making sense?
*107107*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants2_050_son:30-2340]]
You’re saying Baldur tracked us down to find the way to Jötunheim…
*107108*
[[S:::3270-5946]]
but that was before we knew Jötunheim is where we needed to go!
*107109*
[[S:::6988-7857]]
That’s crazy.
*107110*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants2_060_mmr:110-1192]]
Except for one thing…
*107111*
[[S:::1508-4287]]
you are headed for Jötunheim. So he was right.
*107112*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants2_070_son:20-1000]]
I’m so confused.
*107113*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_what_odin_wants2_080_mmr:80-1620]]
Well, then clearly you’ve been listening.
*107114*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_frigg_revealed_010_son:13-788]]
I’m confused.
*107115*
[[S:::1778-3906]]
I always heard that Baldur’s mother was Frigg.
*107116*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_frigg_revealed_020_mmr:280-1240]]
Aye, Frigg…
*107117*
[[S:::1610-3459]]
well, that’s more of a pet name, you see.
*107118*
[[S:::3634-4753]]
It means, “beloved.”
*107119*
[[S:::4962-7489]]
Something Odin called Freya after they wed.
*107120*
[[S:::7770-10370]]
Out of affection, at first, or so I like to believe.
*107121*
[[S:::10850-14250]]
As things turned sour, it became a way to manipulate the truth.
*107122*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_frigg_revealed_030_son:0-663]]
How so?
*107123*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_frigg_revealed_040_mmr:490-5160]]
Odin didn’t want Freya, a Vanir goddess, getting credit for anything in Asgard.
*107124*
[[S:::5510-8750]]
So anything worthy she accomplished was attributed to Frigg.
*107125*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_frigg_revealed_040_mmr_a:50-4578]]
Odin didn’t want Freya, a Vanir goddess, getting credit for anything in Asgard.
*107126*
[[S:::4827-8100]]
So anything worthy she accomplished was attributed to Frigg.
*107127*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_frigg_revealed_050_son:30-1250]]
Like being Baldur’s mother.
*107128*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_roadlore_frigg_revealed_060_mmr:180-1320]]
That’s RIGHT—
*107129*
[[S:::1830-4250]]
Freya was Baldur’s mother all along!
*107130*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_frigg_revealed_070_son:118-850]]
(sighs)
*107131*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_odin_vs_future_010_son:60-400]]
Okay—
*107132*
[[S:::1050-4000]]
tell me again how Odin knew we were going to Jötunheim before we did.
*107133*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_odin_vs_future_020_mmr:1250-5740]]
Odin is extremely clever, you see. Nearly as clever as he thinks he is.
*107134*
[[S:::6140-11160]]
And he’s a collector of prophecies. If it’s about the future, he adds it to his collection.
*107135*
[[S:::11590-15260]]
Helps him style himself as all seeing and all knowing.
*107136*
[[S:::15780-17900]]
But of course the idea is control.
*107137*
[[S:::18480-20630]]
Control of the future, control of his fate…
*107138*
[[S:::21040-25650]]
he’d control every realm of every land in every world if he could.
*107139*
[[S:::26130-29500]]
Every potential pocket of resistance he seeks to eliminate.
*107140*
[[S:::29500-33500]]
Even if you’ve never posed a threat before… he may think one day you might.
*107141*
[[S:::33700-40500]]
So you see… it’s not important how he knew before you did—it’s important that he was right.
*107142*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_odins_plan_010_mmr:63-3129]]
Now don’t go spreading it around that I speak the snake’s tongue.
*107143*
[[S:::3129-6882]]
If Odin ever found that out, it’d be dangerous for all concerned.
*107144*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_odins_plan_030_mmr:80-2800]]
Oh, well, the Giants are the Aesir’s oldest enemies.
*107145*
[[S:::2800-6550]]
They’re fated to wage a successful war against the gods during Ragnarök.
*107146*
[[S:::7010-10480]]
Things don’t end well for him and the Aesir, or even the world for that matter.
*107147*
[[S:::10990-14000]]
Odin hopes to prevent the army of Giants from ever forming.
*107148*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_talks_magni_010_son:50-1690]]
So who were those two men with Baldur?
*107149*
[[S:::2870-4200]]
Are they really the sons of Thor?
*107150*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_talks_magni_020_mmr:0-1408]]
Aye, Magni and Modi.
*107151*
[[S:::1653-4773]]
Two bigger twits you won’t likely find in the halls of Asgard.
*107152*
[[S:::5187-6965]]
They’ll do anything their uncle puts them up to.
*107153*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_talks_magni_030_kra:45-951]]
They are fools.
*107154*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_talks_magni_030_kra_a:28-961]]
They are fools?
*107155*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_talks_magni_040_mmr:50-2090]]
Well, dangerous fools, to be sure.
*107156*
[[S:::2530-4210]]
When they work together, they’re formidable…
*107157*
[[S:::4570-6810]]
but too often it’s a petty competition.
*107158*
[[S:::7250-9170]]
Terribly strong, even as children.
*107159*
[[S:::9560-12750]]
I remember the time Hrungnir the brawler fell upon Thor—
*107160*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_talks_magni_050_kra:0-1154]]
Another time, head.
*107161*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_mimir_talks_magni_060_son:46-687]]
Aw!
*107162*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_serpent_history_010_son:50-460]]
Mimir…
*107163*
[[S:::1010-2830]]
what else did the serpent tell you when you spoke?
*107164*
[[S:::3470-4500]]
Kinda sounded important.
*107165*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_serpent_history_020_mmr:108-3899]]
I’m sure it’s nothing. He just said the boy seemed familiar to him.
*107166*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_serpent_history_030_son:0-520]]
Me?
*107167*
[[S:::1640-2500]]
That’s impossible.
*107168*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_serpent_history_040_mmr:60-1260]]
Oh, I quite agree.
*107169*
[[S:::1630-5440]]
Unless… perhaps… he refers to something yet to be?
*107170*
[[S:::6250-10160]]
It is said that when Jörmungandr and Thor battle at Ragnarök,
*107171*
[[S:::10560-14100]]
their clash so violently shakes the Tree of Life that it splinters,
*107172*
[[S:::14490-17750]]
casting the Serpent backward through time, even before his own birth.
*107173*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_serpent_history_050_son:71-576]]
What!
*107174*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_serpent_history_060_kra:36-1404]]
That is madness.
*107175*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_serpent_history_070_mmr:40-2250]]
Well, I did say not to concern yourself…
*107176*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_oldest_enemies_010_son:0-2750]]
Why’s Odin so desperate to find a way into Jötunheim, anyway?
*107177*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_oldest_enemies_020_mmr:0-5200]]
He’s convinced the Giants hold the key to changing his fate when Ragnarök comes.
*107178*
[[S:::5200-7310]]
They are the Aesir’s oldest enemies, after all—
*107179*
[[S:::7670-11020]]
and it’s their army that’s supposed to do him in, in the end.
*107180*
[[S:::11550-14660]]
But more than that, he covets their gifts of prophecy.
*107181*
[[S:::15100-18070]]
He wants to know what they know, and see what they see.
*107182*
[[S:::18750-25250]]
So much suffering could have been avoided if his insatiable curiosity was not so much stronger than his wisdom.
*107183*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_oldest_enemies_030_son:50-730]]
What do you mean?
*107184*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_oldest_enemies_040_mmr:20-720]]
Ah—
*107185*
[[S:::1440-4500]]
remind me to tell you why they call him the Lord of the Hanged…
*107186*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_giants_gone_010_son:40-480]]
Mimir…
*107187*
[[S:::1370-3660]]
do you know why there are no more Giants left in Midgard?
*107188*
[[S:::4300-6230]]
I mean, not counting the serpent from the future.
*107189*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_giants_gone_020_mmr:80-5050]]
Well, they did not take me into their confidence about that, Odin’s convictions to the contrary.
*107190*
[[S:::5610-6630]]
But I know this—
*107191*
[[S:::7410-12410]]
if I’d spent the better part of sixty winters seeing my best and brightest cut down by Thor and
*107192*
[[S:::12410-13380]]
that damn hammer,
*107193*
[[S:::13830-16000]]
I might very well go home to lick my wounds.
*107194*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_giants_gone_030_mmr:33-3620]]
It’s too bad. I was fond of every Giant I ever met…
*107195*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_giants_gone_040_son:270-2440]]
So that’s why they destroyed the bridges to Jötunheim…
*107196*
[[S:::2930-3880]]
so the Aesir couldn’t follow?
*107197*
[[S:::5230-6500]]
And is that why there’s no tower in the lake?
*107198*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_giants_gone_050_mmr:0-1500]]
I doubt it’s a coincidence.
*107199*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_giants_gone_060_son:37-3154]]
So you think when we get to Jötunheim, we might find Giants there?
*107200*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_giants_gone_070_mmr:70-1250]]
Anything’s possible.
*107201*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_odin_worldtree_010_son:40-2000]]
So why do they call Odin the Lord of the Hanged?
*107202*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_odin_worldtree_020_mmr:16-3224]]
That refers to a modest example of Odin’s thirst for knowledge—
*107203*
[[S:::3397-5512]]
the time he spent nine days a dead man.
*107204*
[[S:::5812-8194]]
Hung himself by the neck from Yggdrasil’s branches,
*107205*
[[S:::8268-11970]]
put his spear through his own side, and bled down into the Well of Destiny.
*107206*
[[S:::12276-16370]]
He roamed the realms of the dead and plundered the World Tree of its secrets…
*107207*
[[S:::16370-20475]]
until, I think quite rightly, it got fed up with him and sent him back to the land of the living.
*107208*
[[S:::21003-23360]]
Did I not mention he was barking mad?
*107209*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_odin_worldtree_020_mmr_a:16-3269]]
That refers to a modest example of Odin’s thirst for knowledge—
*107210*
[[S:::3428-5614]]
the time he spent nine days a dead man.
*107211*
[[S:::5832-9005]]
Aye! Hung himself by the neck from Yggdrasil’s branches,
*107212*
[[S:::9061-12689]]
put his spear through his own side, and bled down into the Well of Destiny.
*107213*
[[S:::13005-17114]]
He roamed the realms of the dead and plundered the World Tree of its secrets…
*107214*
[[S:::17114-21076]]
until, I think quite rightly, it got fed up with him and sent him back to the land of the living.
*107215*
[[S:::21863-24101]]
Did I not mention he was barking mad?
*107216*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_nothing_written_010_son:24-1399]]
Here’s something I can’t figure out…
*107217*
[[S:::1977-3408]]
Odin wants to prevent Ragnarök…
*107218*
[[S:::4123-5961]]
but the Serpent’s already been there and seen it.
*107219*
[[S:::6826-7835]]
So hasn’t he already failed?
*107220*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_nothing_written_020_mmr:30-1400]]
Fate’s a tricky thing, lad.
*107221*
[[S:::1880-5000]]
And Odin’s just arrogant enough to think he can get the best of it.
*107222*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_nothing_written_030_kra:0-2020]]
Fate is another lie told by the gods.
*107223*
[[S:::2710-5500]]
Nothing is written that cannot be unwritten.
*107224*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_nothing_written_040_mmr:40-3060]]
On that, brother, you and the Allfather may just agree.
*107225*
[[S:::3890-9130]]
Even if he can’t prevent Ragnarök, he still hopes to learn enough details to influence the outcome.
*107226*
[[S:::9880-12250]]
Remind me later to tell you about the wolves…
*107227*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_mjolnir_lore_010_son:40-800]]
So, Mimir…
*107228*
[[S:::1550-3250]]
seemed like maybe you know Brok and Sindri…
*107229*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_mjolnir_lore_020_mmr:60-1459]]
Oh, the “Huldra Brothers”…?
*107230*
[[S:::1666-2793]]
Well, who doesn’t?
*107231*
[[S:::2964-6185]]
They’re quite famous. Or infamous, depending on your point of view.
*107232*
[[S:::6920-9435]]
They crafted Mjölnir, you see—Thor’s Hammer?
*107233*
[[S:::9690-13769]]
The Aesir’s greatest murder weapon, the bane of Giant-kind…
*107234*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_mjolnir_lore_030_son:40-1240]]
THEY made Thor’s hammer?
*107235*
[[S:::2369-3762]]
I didn’t think they liked the Aesir.
*107236*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_mjolnir_lore_030_son_a:40-1240]]
THEY made Thor’s hammer?
*107237*
[[S:::2330-3772]]
I didn’t think they liked the Aesir.
*107238*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_mjolnir_lore_040_mmr:40-1600]]
Oh, I should say not…
*107239*
[[S:::1870-5071]]
but this was long ago, and they were eager to make a name for themselves.
*107240*
[[S:::5640-8041]]
Rather overdid it with that one, methinks.
*107241*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_huldra_bros_010_son:19-534]]
Hang on…
*107242*
[[S:::1166-1652]]
Mimir,
*107243*
[[S:::2132-4065]]
you called Brok and Sindri the Huldra Brothers?
*107244*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_huldra_bros_020_mmr:0-580]]
Aye.
*107245*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_huldra_bros_030_son:65-538]]
But…
*107246*
[[S:::728-1554]]
they’re dwarves,
*107247*
[[S:::1844-2330]]
aren’t they?
*107248*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_huldra_bros_040_mmr:52-549]]
Aye.
*107249*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_huldra_bros_050_son:80-1750]]
And Huldra are sprites of the forest…
*107250*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_huldra_bros_060_mmr:300-2750]]
Aye, beautiful, seductive sprites of the forest.
*107251*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_huldra_bros_070_son:20-2500]]
So why would you call Brok and Sindri the Huldra Brothers?
*107252*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_huldra_bros_080_mmr:170-6190]]
Oh… well… I now realise this would be a wholly inappropriate story for young and innocent ears.
*107253*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_huldra_bros_090_son:29-1923]]
Tsk. Whatever.
*107254*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_blade_deflect_010_son:120-586]]
Look,
*107255*
[[S:::1359-2072]]
don’t be mad…
*107256*
[[S:::2779-4257]]
but I’ve seen those blades of yours before.
*107257*
[[S:::5241-7230]]
They were under the house, when I was hiding.
*107258*
[[S:::7956-9306]]
Is that why you never let me down there?
*107259*
[[S:::10501-11357]]
Where’d they come from?
*107260*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_blade_deflect_020_kra:50-1425]]
They are my burden.
*107261*
[[S:::1680-3440]]
From a life that is behind me.
*107262*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_blade_deflect_030_son:70-512]]
Well,

[[S:::870-1909]]
they’re in my life too, now,
*107264*
[[S:::2370-3503]]
and I’d like to hear that story.
*107265*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_blade_deflect_040_kra:40-1490]]
Those days are dead.
*107266*
[[S:::2000-3190]]
To relive them is…
*107267*
[[S:::3840-4735]]
needless.
*107268*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_blade_deflect_050_son:30-1750]]
How can it be needless if it’s the truth?
*107269*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_blade_deflect_060_kra:40-1070]]
One day,
*107270*
[[S:::1430-2847]]
you will understand.
*107271*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_blade_deflect_070_son:11-1003]]
I’ll take your word for it…
*107272*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_seriously_hel_010_mmr:0-4830]]
I know I’ve been up on a mountain for a while now, but since when do the dead not stay dead?
*107273*
[[S:::5280-8810]]
A little resurrection among friends is one thing—I can hardly complain…
*107274*
[[S:::9390-12250]]
but it’s as if Hel itself is shambling into Midgard.
*107275*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_seriously_hel_020_son:0-1930]]
Freya said the world was out of balance…
*107276*
[[S:::2560-4250]]
that somebody meddled with forces.
*107277*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_seriously_hel_030_mmr:0-1270]]
Oh, that’s plain to see.
*107278*
[[S:::1700-3960]]
And Odin is the king of meddlers.
*107279*
[[S:::4500-6780]]
But I shudder to think what he did to cause this…
*107280*
[[S:::7330-8850]]
perhaps it involves the Valkyries.
*107281*
[[S:::9390-11750]]
That’d be playing a dangerous game indeed…
*107282*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_roadlore_laufey_010_son:70-680]]
Mimir…
*107283*
[[S:::1410-2350]]
what did you call mother?
*107284*
[[S:::3450-4530]]
Laufey the Just?
*107285*
[[S:::5550-6130]]
Did you know her?
*107286*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_laufey_020_mmr:0-1320]]
I never had the pleasure.
*107287*
[[S:::2000-4612]]
Laufey was a rumour in the halls of Asgard—
*107288*
[[S:::4980-9250]]
a Giantess warrior who thwarted many an Aesir god’s plans.
*107289*
[[S:::9650-13247]]
Freeing those who they would enslave, feeding those who they would starve,
*107290*
[[S:::13389-17238]]
generally making a nuisance of herself in the most noble of ways.
*107291*
[[S:::17660-21287]]
Thor was terribly frustrated he could never find her to fight.
*107292*
[[S:::21790-23375]]
Once my imprisonment began,
*107293*
[[S:::23600-25387]]
I could only wonder what became of her,
*107294*
[[S:::25680-27579]]
and who she would turn out to be.
*107295*
[[S:::28220-30850]]
Yours is quite a singular lineage, lad.
*107296*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_freya_stop_010_mmr:0-559]]

*107297*
[[S:::701-2280]]
there is another thing I must let you know,
*107298*
[[S:::2632-4464]]
from the time you were away in Jötunheim.
*107299*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_freya_stop_020_kra:0-570]]
Well?

[[S:::1560-2368]]
Tell us then.
*107301*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_freya_stop_030_mmr:80-1240]]
It concerns Freya.
*107302*
[[S:::1940-2889]]
She… paid me a visit.
*107303*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_freya_stop_040_kra:9-1378]]
Are you bewitched again?
*107304*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_freya_stop_050_mmr:36-2064]]
No, no… well, I don’t think so…
*107305*
[[S:::2682-6992]]
I thought it best to tell her what she wanted to know before any seiðr became necessary.
*107306*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_roadlore_freya_stop_060_kra:0-1250]]
What did you tell her?
*107307*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_roadlore_freya_stop_070_mmr:0-3360]]
What little I know about where Odin may have kept her Valkyrie wings.
*107308*
[[S:::3780-6956]]
Seems she’s rather bent on reclaiming her warrior spirit.
*107309*
[[S:::7550-11507]]
I’m afraid the cycle of vengeance may not be so easily broken.
*107310*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s005_010_son:0-400]]

*107311*
[[S:::1250-4750]]
the voice, from the sword… it says we can go this way!
*107312*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s005_020_son:0-450]]
Come on…
*107313*
[[S:::900-2150]]
let’s pick up where we left off.
*107314*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s005_030_son:63-2098]]
This way! It’ll save time.
*107315*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010a_010_son:0-688]]
Wow…
*107316*
[[S:::1510-2550]]
it’s hot here.
*107317*
[[S:::3300-3600]]
But… is that…
*107318*
[[S:::4730-6058]]
snow?
*107319*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s010a_020_kra:70-710]]
Ash.
*107320*
[[S:::1300-3569]]
It only falls like that for great fires.
*107321*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s010a_030_mmr:100-6775]]
The whole realm is a great fire… the source of fire itself, and all the sun and stars, if legend is to be believed.
*107322*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010a_040_son:30-990]]
Should we believe?
*107323*
[[S:::1650-2075]]
I mean…
*107324*
[[S:::2710-3480]]
we’re here,
*107325*
[[S:::4030-5057]]
and we’re not on fire.
*107326*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s010a_050_kra:9-872]]
Not yet.
*107327*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s010a_060_mmr:20-4656]]
Well, you know… I suppose it’s cooled considerably since the dawn of creation, hasn’t it?
*107328*
[[S:::5226-7902]]
Niflheim isn’t exactly ice these days either.
*107329*
[[S:::8172-9440]]
It’s in the nature of things–
*107330*
[[S:::9735-11963]]
extremes are tempered by time.
*107331*
[[S:::12322-15380]]
Fires burn colder, men grow old and grey…
*107332*
[[S:::15567-18892]]
heads are chopped off and attached to belts. Such is life!
*107333*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010a_070_son:20-2406]]
Uh… okay, Mimir…
*107334*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010b_010_son:40-460]]
Wow…
*107335*
[[S:::1510-2530]]
it’s hot here.
*107336*
[[S:::3300-3600]]
But… is that…
*107337*
[[S:::4730-5750]]
snow?
*107338*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s010b_020_kra:70-700]]
Ash.
*107339*
[[S:::1300-3250]]
It only falls like that for great fires.
*107340*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010b_030_son:0-773]]
Well…
*107341*
[[S:::773-3623]]
this is supposed to be the greatest fire of all, isn’t it?
*107342*
[[S:::4515-7500]]
Muspelheim, the ancient realm of flame…
*107343*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s010b_040_kra:0-1250]]
Did your mother speak of it?
*107344*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010b_050_son:50-950]]
Not a whole lot.
*107345*
[[S:::1540-2340]]
I mean…
*107346*
[[S:::2340-4890]]
there’s not many stories that take place in… fire.
*107347*
[[S:::5640-8030]]
Except among the fire giants, I guess.
*107348*
[[S:::8997-11089]]
But I don’t think they talk to others much.
*107349*
[[S:::11440-13128]]
And no one’s seen one in forever…
*107350*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010b_060_son:20-1750]]
I wonder what Surtr’s Gauntlet is…
*107351*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s010b_070_kra:0-450]]
What?
*107352*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s010b_070_kra_a:0-570]]
What?
*107353*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010b_080_son:123-1611]]
It’s what those runes said we could find here.
*107354*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s010b_090_kra:13-2370]]
Hm… we shall look.
*107355*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010c_010_son:70-380]]
Oh…
*107356*
[[S:::1230-3250]]
you just feel like a long walk in the heat, I guess.
*107357*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010c_020_son:30-450]]
Really?
*107358*
[[S:::1230-3000]]
Shouldn’t we save our strength for the challenge?
*107359*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010c_020_son_a:60-370]]
Really?
*107360*
[[S:::1200-3000]]
Shouldn’t we save our strength for the challenge?
*107361*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010c_030_son:50-1250]]
Did you forget the shortcut?
*107362*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010c_040_son:50-1250]]
Why wouldn’t we use the shortcut?
*107363*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010c_050_son:60-1510]]
You wanna go this way again?
*107364*
[[S:::2490-2750]]
Oh, boy…
*107365*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s010c_060_son:50-2150]]
You know we don’t have to go this way, right?
*107366*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s015_010_son:120-610]]
Listen…
*107367*
[[S:::1580-2250]]
I hear a voice…
*107368*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s015_020_kra:30-750]]
Another elf?
*107369*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s015_030_son:70-960]]
I don’t think so…
*107370*
[[S:::1920-2920]]
it’s coming from up there…
*107371*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s015_040_son:1230-2500]]
Oh…! I mean besides Brok…
*107372*
[[S:::3100-4660]]
up there! To the right…!
*107373*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s015_050_son:0-1250]]
You must like the heat, Brok…
*107374*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s020_010_son:50-540]]
Mimir,
*107375*
[[S:::1440-3100]]
did you ever hear of Surtr’s Gauntlet?
*107376*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s020_020_mmr:0-5340]]
Not as such. But it sounds like the fire giant’s training ground, where he kept himself in fighting
*107377*
[[S:::5340-6500]]
shape for Ragnarök.
*107378*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_mus_s020_030_mmr:0-4630]]
I can tell you all about Surtr sometime, when we’ve got a nice boat ride and not everything is on
*107379*
[[S:::4630-5000]]
fire.
*107380*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s020_040_son:40-3383]]
So how do we know Surtr didn’t go to Jötunheim with the rest of the giants?
*107381*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s020_050_mmr:50-3080]]
Well, why would he? He’s a pre-Bergelmirian giant.
*107382*
[[S:::3520-5960]]
Muspel was his home long before the flood.
*107383*
[[S:::6340-10000]]
It’s better this way, both for him, and for everything not on fire.
*107384*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s020_060_son:90-520]]
Oofta… !
*107385*
[[S:::1580-2940]]
I forgot how hot it was here.
*107386*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s020_070_mmr:40-2290]]
Well, it is a realm of primordial fire.
*107387*
[[S:::2690-5500]]
If it weren’t a little balmy, I’d be concerned.
*107388*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s020_080_son:0-350]]
Oh,
*107389*
[[S:::1130-2500]]
I am not getting used to the heat…
*107390*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s020_090_mmr:50-1500]]
Wait ’til you have a beard to singe…
*107391*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s020_100_son:54-1905]]
Ugh… there’s that heat again.
*107392*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s020_110_mmr:30-1860]]
Aye, but it’s a dry heat…
*107393*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s025_010_son:60-872]]
Oh wow.
*107394*
[[S:::1342-2618]]
It’s a lava waterfall.
*107395*
[[S:::3421-4275]]
It’s a lava-fall.
*107396*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s025_020_mmr:45-2157]]
Yes, this isn’t at ALL terrifying, is it?
*107397*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s025_030_son:66-2196]]
Oop! There goes my arm-hair.
*107398*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s025_040_mmr:32-1715]]
Oh… do be careful.
*107399*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s030_010_son:57-2516]]
The voice! It’s just around this corner…
*107400*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s030_011_son:50-350]]
Oh!…
*107401*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s030_020_son:40-1180]]
…it’s a great big sword.
*107402*
[[S:::2400-4000]]
It wants to know if we’re ready to train?
*107403*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s030_030_son:53-3503]]
There’s another sword! This must be the next challenge.
*107404*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s030_040_son:47-7144]]
Another sword! I wonder how many of these there are. Oh, it’s six. The voice says six.
*107405*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s030_050_son:93-1158]]
Found the next sword!
*107406*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s030_060_son:42-3391]]
There’s a sword! What’s this, the fifth?
*107407*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_010_son:90-2180]]
It says there’s another level to this challenge –
*107408*
[[S:::3140-4250]]
harder than before….
*107409*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_020_son:52-2674]]
Now it wants to know if we’re ready for the ultimate challenge!
*107410*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_030_kra:39-1773]]
It is not the time for this.
*107411*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_040_son:26-723]]
Aw…
*107412*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s035_050_mmr:30-420]]
Ah,
*107413*
[[S:::820-2250]]
out here just to breathe the ash, then…
*107414*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_060_kra:20-520]]
No.
*107415*
[[S:::930-1500]]
Not now.
*107416*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_070_son:40-640]]
Okay…
*107417*
[[S:::1370-2250]]
what are we doin’ then?
*107418*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_080_kra:0-1250]]
We do not need this now.
*107419*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_090_son:20-908]]
Whatever you say…
*107420*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_100_kra:0-480]]
No.
*107421*
[[S:::910-2000]]
Our journey awaits…
*107422*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_110_son:60-500]]
’kay then.…
*107423*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_120_son:50-1054]]
The gate’s closed…!
*107424*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_130_kra:30-1000]]
Prepare yourself, boy.
*107425*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_140_son:28-605]]
Yes sir!
*107426*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_150_kra:0-750]]
Be ready, boy.
*107427*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_160_son:0-500]]
I am!
*107428*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_170_kra:30-750]]
Here they come.
*107429*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_180_son:0-500]]
I’m ready!
*107430*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_190_kra:98-929]]
It begins.
*107431*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_200_son:27-779]]
Here we go…!
*107432*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_210_kra:10-453]]
Ready?
*107433*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_220_son:30-350]]
Ready!
*107434*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s035_230_mmr:1840-3750]]
Ehhhh…  oh! You meant the boy, of course.
*107435*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_240_kra:0-750]]
Follow my lead.
*107436*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_250_son:49-816]]
Say the word…
*107437*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_260_kra:30-750]]
We go again.
*107438*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_270_son:30-350]]
Sir!
*107439*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_280_kra:30-750]]
Once more.
*107440*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_290_son:73-907]]
Let’s do it!
*107441*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_300_kra:50-719]]
Again.
*107442*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_310_son:50-600]]
Why not..!
*107443*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s035_320_kra:0-750]]
One more time.
*107444*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s035_330_son:44-1270]]
Okay, I’m ready…
*107445*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_010_son:30-710]]
It stopped.
*107446*
[[S:::1690-2250]]
We failed?
*107447*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s040_020_kra:0-1790]]
There is no failure in training.
*107448*
[[S:::2420-4250]]
We can surpass it with practice.
*107449*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_030_son:70-500]]
Sure,
*107450*
[[S:::1010-2750]]
or we could come back with better weapons and armour.
*107451*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s040_040_mmr:0-1000]]
A fair point.
*107452*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_050_son:20-4041]]
Hmph…. Think we can beat it, or do we need better gear?
*107453*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_060_son:70-1530]]
I feel like maybe we’ll be better at that…
*107454*
[[S:::2260-2750]]
later.
*107455*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_070_son:50-800]]
We lost again?
*107456*
[[S:::2020-2710]]
I dunno,
*107457*
[[S:::3300-4210]]
can we do this?
*107458*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_080_son:90-560]]
Okay,
*107459*
[[S:::1100-1930]]
what are we doing wrong?
*107460*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_090_son:80-3000]]
Why can’t we do this? Would some better gear help?
*107461*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_090_son_a:70-2900]]
Why can’t we do this? Would some better gear help?
*107462*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_100_son:60-3100]]
I know this is training… but it still hurts.
*107463*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_110_son:30-660]]
Aww…
*107464*
[[S:::1240-2250]]
we were close that time!
*107465*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_120_son:29-1135]]
We had that…
*107466*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_130_son:33-2350]]
Ugh… all that for nothing!
*107467*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_140_son:120-800]]
Oh no!
*107468*
[[S:::1410-2250]]
I thought we had it…!
*107469*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_150_son:147-2229]]
Aw, man… almost!
*107470*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s040_160_mmr:0-1880]]
Well… this seems frustrating…
*107471*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_170_son:60-440]]
Boy,
*107472*
[[S:::1110-2520]]
we didn’t come CLOSE that time.
*107473*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_180_son:39-1558]]
I’m not sure we’re ready for that one.
*107474*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_190_son:31-2015]]
That’s not fair–we weren’t ready.
*107475*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_200_son:50-1650]]
I’m not sure we have the right gear for this.
*107476*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_210_son:70-580]]
Okay…
*107477*
[[S:::1010-2000]]
that was kinda sad.
*107478*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s040_220_son:9-2596]]
C’mon… I know we can do better than that!
*107479*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_010_son:61-3091]]
We did it! That was a little crazy…
*107480*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_020_son:0-1314]]
Hey, look at us!
*107481*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_030_son:160-2110]]
Did we win? We won!
*107482*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_040_son:47-2211]]
Whew! We actually did it!
*107483*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_050_son:260-640]]
Haha…
*107484*
[[S:::1220-1750]]
YES!
*107485*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_060_son:30-880]]
All right!
*107486*
[[S:::1620-2790]]
Glad we could get through that.
*107487*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_070_son:20-430]]
Ha…
*107488*
[[S:::1100-2380]]
gets a little easier every time.
*107489*
[[S:::3030-3250]]
Right…?
*107490*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_080_son:40-1990]]
Wow… that was fun!
*107491*
[[S:::2557-3200]]
And hard…
*107492*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s045_090_mmr:390-1750]]
Whew–nicely done!
*107493*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s045_100_mmr:290-1750]]
Most impressive, brothers…!
*107494*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s045_110_mmr:12-3780]]
That was outstanding! Wish I had a better view.
*107495*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s045_120_mmr:30-350]]
Well!
*107496*
[[S:::710-2900]]
I think you’ve gotten pretty good at THAT.
*107497*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_130_son:124-1518]]
And look – there’s loot!
*107498*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s045_140_mmr:45-5229]]
Wouldn’t it be nice to find some incense, just once? The smell of brimstone gets old quickly…
*107499*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_150_son:890-1110]]
Whoo! Alright…! Treasure time…
*107500*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s045_160_mmr:45-5229]]
Wouldn’t it be nice to find some incense, just once? The smell of brimstone gets old quickly…
*107501*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_170_son:8-5540]]
The sword’s back! He’s saying we’re free to go… but if we want to train further, there’s one more
*107502*
[[S:::5540-6386]]
challenge here.
*107503*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_172_son:0-1890]]
One more challenge and they’ll open the gate forward.
*107504*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_173_son:0-1180]]
One more round to open the gate,
*107505*
[[S:::2110-2920]]
or are we done for now?
*107506*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_174_son:2-3528]]
Guess we haven’t opened the way forward yet. One more challenge?
*107507*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_175_son:7-2191]]
Think we’re ready to do one more and get that gate open?
*107508*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_176_son:9-3888]]
Now both gates are down – we can go up to the next challenge if you want!
*107509*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_180_son:45-1351]]
Another gate opened up!
*107510*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_190_son:41-1037]]
There’s the way through!
*107511*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_200_son:50-300]]
Gate open!
*107512*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s045_210_son:0-400]]
I see the way up…!
*107513*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s050_005_son:0-1170]]
The voice is impressed…
*107514*
[[S:::1990-3860]]
he says for anyone that can beat a Valkyrie,
*107515*
[[S:::4400-6140]]
he’ll unlock a new level of challenges.
*107516*
[[S:::6580-8220]]
I think all the swords just came back!
*107517*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s050_010_son:60-2350]]
All RIGHT! I think we mastered that one…
*107518*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s050_030_son:150-2510]]
We did it! We beat every level of every test.
*107519*
[[S:::2900-4710]]
I don’t think even Ragnarök could stop us now…!
*107520*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s055_010_son:0-2140]]
So… nobody lives here,
*107521*
[[S:::2720-3153]]
do they?
*107522*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s055_020_mmr:40-5441]]
Only a fire giant could be at home here, and according to prophecy, we won’t see them again till Ragnarök.
*107523*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s055_030_kra:50-1250]]
We should explore further.
*107524*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s055_040_son:30-2000]]
My hands are so sweaty I can barely grip the bow…
*107525*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s055_050_mmr:40-1250]]
Well, my nose itches.
*107526*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s055_060_kra:50-1500]]
Wipe them before you fire.
*107527*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s055_070_son:160-667]]
I know…
*107528*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s055_080_son:110-1341]]
I keep breathing in ash…
*107529*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s055_090_mmr:0-2000]]
Imagine breathing it in from your throat-stump!
*107530*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s055_100_son:32-1643]]
Uh… I really can’t…
*107531*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s055_110_kra:0-1000]]
Do you feel sick?
*107532*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s055_120_son:130-560]]
No!
*107533*
[[S:::1180-1990]]
No, it’s…
*107534*
[[S:::2710-3250]]
just weird.
*107535*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s055_130_son:70-2230]]
I don’t usually get nervous when we climb…
*107536*
[[S:::3580-4380]]
but don’t slip.
*107537*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s055_140_mmr:0-1500]]
I strongly concur.
*107538*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s055_150_kra:0-750]]
I will not.
*107539*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s055_160_son:70-2210]]
Okay, my eyes are really stinging now.
*107540*
[[S:::2940-4009]]
And my throat burns.
*107541*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s055_170_mmr:40-3000]]
Well, it wouldn’t be a challenge without a little challenge, would it?
*107542*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_mus_s055_180_kra:0-1580]]
Weapons are honed by fire,
*107543*
[[S:::1980-2940]]
not by comfort.
*107544*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s055_190_son:60-2670]]
If we could take this temperature and combine it with Helheim’s,
*107545*
[[S:::3260-4250]]
it’d probably be perfect.
*107546*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_mus_s055_200_mmr:70-2710]]
And if the all-father had wings, he’d be a dragon.
*107547*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s055_210_son:10-465]]
Huh?
*107548*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_mus_s055_210_son_a:9-390]]
Huh?
*107549*
[[S::vo_lvl_clbq1_s900_010_son_stem:8900-16060]]
That’s a Soul Eater! If that kills us, that’s it. No Valhalla. No Hel. No afterlife. Ever!
*107550*
[[S:::23330-23870]]
Oh.
*107551*
[[S:::24870-26510]]
Mom made them sound more dangerous than that.
*107552*
[[S::vo_lvl_clbq1_s900_010_kra_stem:18140-19110]]
It does not attack.
*107553*
[[S:::28030-29710]]
Then do not drop your guard.
*107554*
[[S:::30660-31000]]
Come.
*107555*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s002_010_brk:0-2500]]
You rush around like that everywhere? Yeesh.
*107556*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s002_020_brk:130-3000]]
C’mere already! You’re gonna be real happy.
*107557*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s002_030_son:30-605]]
Wait—
*107558*
[[S:::1300-2339]]
aren’t we talking to Brok?
*107559*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s002_040_brk:26-819]]
Catch!
*107560*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s002_050_brk:0-5180]]
Seeing as you’re my only customers, you need a quick way back to me with all your ill-gottens.
*107561*
[[S:::5600-5950]]
Lookie…
*107562*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s002_060_brk:0-1470]]
The pile of rocks there—with that Key of Yggdrasil,
*107563*
[[S:::2140-7950]]
you can open a magic door to the branches of the World Tree—
*107564*
[[S:::8340-10530]]
a shortcut ’tween the realms.
*107565*
[[S:::11050-15170]]
If y’ever see ’em out in the world, use it to get back to me quick.
*107566*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s002_080_brk:0-360]]
But it’s one-way only—straight back here and nowhere else.
*107567*
[[S:::760-1450]]
And whatever you do,
*107568*
[[S:::1800-5860]]
never, never, EVER, never, ever, ever,
*107569*
[[S:::6270-14420]]
ever,
*107570*
[[S:::14820-16500]]
ever throw yourself over the edge of the path… lest you want death.
*107571*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s002_090_son:50-520]]
Yeah,
*107572*
[[S:::1220-2250]]
I don’t see us wanting that.
*107573*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s005_010_brk:0-670]]
Good!
*107574*
[[S:::1020-3750]]
Now when you’re done gawkin’, I got a favour to ask.
*107575*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s007_010_brk:0-1500]]
Got time fer a favour?
*107576*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s007_020_brk:40-1250]]
I’m not gonna beg ya.
*107577*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s010_005_kra:80-1000]]
What is it, dwarf?
*107578*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s010_010_brk:77-4417]]
There’s this Alchemist, Andvari, been workin’ outta the Völunder Mines.
*107579*
[[S:::4659-9344]]
Haven’t heard from him in mebbe, oh I dunno… a hundred winters or so?
*107580*
[[S:::9796-12827]]
Probably dead, but uh, mebbe you can find him.
*107581*
[[S:::12934-16150]]
He’s Dwarven like me. Wears a fancy green ring.
*107582*
[[S:::16303-18627]]
Owes me a favour. You’ll look?
*107583*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s010_020_kra:50-1170]]
If it is on our path…
*107584*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s010_030_brk:80-1860]]
Oh I see how it is.
*107585*
[[S:::2280-4420]]
Not a somethin’ fer nuthin’ type, are ya?
*107586*
[[S:::5030-5980]]
Fine.
*107587*
[[S:::6400-9760]]
If ya find Andvari, I’ll make him whip ya up somethin’ special.
*107588*
[[S:::10390-13250]]
This entry stone here oughtta get you inside those mines.
*107589*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s010_032_brk:0-2810]]
The Völunder Mines is right through these doors.
*107590*
[[S:::3320-6210]]
Might as well have a look-see inside, don’tcha think?
*107591*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s010_040_brk:70-3440]]
I need that Alchemist for something I’m stewing up for you.
*107592*
[[S:::3900-5940]]
If’n you’re smart, you’ll find him.
*107593*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s010_050_brk:0-2750]]
You scare up that Alchemist what needed finding?
*107594*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s015_010_son:48-3836]]
Uh… these runes read ’Death inside’
*107595*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s030_010_son:50-770]]
So…
*107596*
[[S:::1190-3240]]
Brok said his friend was Dwarven like him,
*107597*
[[S:::4140-5000]]
wearing a green ring.
*107598*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s030_020_kra:0-1000]]
Look if you wish.
*107599*
[[S:::1420-3380]]
I will be gathering resources for our journey.
*107600*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s030_030_son:34-960]]
You don’t want to help him?
*107601*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s030_040_kra:0-250]]
No.
*107602*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s030_050_son:20-500]]
Why not?
*107603*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s030_060_kra:0-2200]]
Because I do not run errands for dwarves.
*107604*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s030_070_son:46-528]]
Oh.
*107605*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s040_010_son:50-788]]
Dwarven.
*107606*
[[S:::1123-1718]]
But no ring.
*107607*
[[S:::2400-3274]]
One of his crew?
*107608*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s040_020_kra:0-1121]]
Scorch marks—
*107609*
[[S:::1390-2750]]
there along the floor and wall.
*107610*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s040_030_son:0-557]]
Weird.
*107611*
[[S:::1270-2250]]
I guess we keep looking.
*107612*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s040_031_kra:50-680]]
We?
*107613*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s040_032_son:40-670]]
I mean
*107614*
[[S:::1240-2130]]
I’LL keep looking.
*107615*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s040_040_son:40-1000]]
Soul Eater got him.
*107616*
[[S:::1860-3510]]
Must have been part of that Alchemist’s crew.
*107617*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s050_010_son:40-2160]]
We should look at more of these bodies, right?
*107618*
[[S:::2830-4190]]
Any of them could be Brok’s friend.
*107619*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s050_020_kra:67-598]]
Mmph.
*107620*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s050_030_son:50-1500]]
They probably have useful loot, too…
*107621*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s060_010_kra:88-693]]
Not him.
*107622*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s060_020_son:30-380]]
Hey,
*107623*
[[S:::1210-1800]]
I thought you didn’t care.
*107624*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s060_030_kra:30-2000]]
I noticed the lack of ring while looting the body.
*107625*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s060_040_son:30-250]]
Oh.
*107626*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s070_010_son:4-2330]]
There’s the ring! On that severed hand!
*107627*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s070_020_son:60-1750]]
…attached to the Soul Eater.
*107628*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s070_030_son:0-390]]
Well,
*107629*
[[S:::1610-3100]]
we know what happened to Andvari now;
*107630*
[[S:::4360-5510]]
we can just go tell Brok.
*107631*
[[S:::6350-7400]]
No need to fight it,
*107632*
[[S:::7950-8250]]
right?
*107633*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s070_040_kra:0-400]]
No.
*107634*
[[S:::960-1660]]
We will fight it.
*107635*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s070_050_son:14-754]]
But why?
*107636*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s070_060_kra:40-1500]]
Because you are frightened of it.
*107637*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s080_010_son:45-2443]]
He’s got both hands. This isn’t him.
*107638*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s080_020_son:60-680]]
No ring.
*107639*
[[S:::1480-3040]]
We’re not gonna find Brok’s friend alive,
*107640*
[[S:::3480-3920]]
are we…
*107641*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s080_020_son_a:49-4066]]
No ring. We’re not gonna find Brok’s friend alive, are we…
*107642*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s080_030_son:42-1210]]
It was a massacre…
*107643*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s090_010_son:60-3200]]
This is crazy! How are we supposed to kill something made of rock!?
*107644*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s090_020_kra:30-1180]]
Be strong, Atreus.
*107645*
[[S:::1650-3980]]
Stay focused. And look for a weak point.
*107646*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s090_030_son:2-508]]
Yes, sir.
*107647*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s100_009_kra:30-900]]
Stay quiet.
*107648*
[[S:::1620-2750]]
Make no sudden movement.
*107649*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s100_010_son:50-570]]
Look out!
*107650*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s110_010_son:40-2190]]
We did it! I can’t believe it.
*107651*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s110_020_kra:50-760]]
Believe it.
*107652*
[[S:::1340-3000]]
You are stronger than you know.
*107653*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s110_030_son:0-760]]
Thank you, father.
*107654*
[[S:::1730-3000]]
Let’s see if that’s the Alchemist’s ring.
*107655*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s130_010_kra:0-610]]
Green ring…
*107656*
[[S:::1410-2500]]
Dwarvish inscription…
*107657*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s130_020_son:30-920]]
The Alchemist.
*107658*
[[S:::1460-2390]]
But where’s the rest of him?
*107659*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s130_030_kra:50-1250]]
Ashes, most likely.
*107660*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s130_040_son:70-990]]
The Soul Eater got him…
*107661*
[[S:::2060-3500]]
I guess we should bring this back to Brok.
*107662*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s120_010_son:0-1300]]
These Runes were written fast.
*107663*
[[S:::2600-3200]]
It spells out:
*107664*
[[S:::4600-5730]]
“Í Gimsteini.”
*107665*
[[S:::7100-8730]]
Hmm… I don’t know that one.
*107666*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s120_020_kra:40-1000]]
We will ask the blue one.
*107667*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s120_030_son:52-1262]]
So now you’re interested?
*107668*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s120_040_kra:50-1500]]
We found his Alchemist.
*107669*
[[S:::1960-3250]]
A reward was promised.
*107670*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_009_brk:38-1067]]
What’d you find?
*107671*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_020_kra:40-750]]
Your Alchemist.
*107672*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_040_son:57-6057]]
I’m sorry, Brok. The hand is all we could find, still wearing the ring. There was a Soul Eater
*107673*
[[S:::6057-9783]]
inside, and well… it must have burned away the rest of him.
*107674*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_050_son:0-1310]]
We think he left a message…
*107675*
[[S:::2200-5350]]
does “Í Gimsteini” mean anything to you?
*107676*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_060_brk:70-2800]]
Mmm, can’t say it do.
*107677*
[[S:::3180-6400]]
Andvari always did have a thing fer cryptic messages.
*107678*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_070_brk:3-3210]]
S’pose you’ll still be wantin’ some compensation, huh?
*107679*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_080_kra:44-722]]
Naturally.
*107680*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_090_brk:40-1250]]
“Naturally,” he says.
*107681*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_091_brk:18-1524]]
Mjonefr uxi…
*107682*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_100_brk:0-2410]]
I’ll take a closer look at this here ring.
*107683*
[[S:::2860-6440]]
Maybe Andvari left a bit a magic inside ’fore he croaked.
*107684*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_110_son:32-951]]
Dwarves can do that?
*107685*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_120_brk:50-4150]]
Sure. Dwarves and magic jewels is like flies and pig lips.
*107686*
[[S:::4550-5500]]
Supple ones.
*107687*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_clbq1_s140_130_son:57-2615]]
Ew. I’m not as interested as I thought.
*107688*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s005_010_son:45-2207]]
That’s an interesting gate… I wonder who built it?
*107689*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s005_020_son:60-900]]
These ruins again…
*107690*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s005_030_son:27-2914]]
Wow… It’s like there was an entire city under the water!
*107691*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s005_040_mmr:0-2000]]
Aye, lad. A forgotten city.
*107692*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s005_050_son:33-747]]
What was it called?
*107693*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s005_060_mmr:120-670]]
Erm, well…
*107694*
[[S:::1120-1750]]
I forgot!
*107695*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s005_070_son:0-960]]
What happened to this city?
*107696*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s005_080_mmr:81-5123]]
I’m not entirely sure, lad. It was abandoned long before Jörmungandr came to town and flooded the
*107697*
[[S:::5123-5431]]
place.
*107698*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s005_090_son:0-2180]]
Hmm… I wonder what it was like to live here.
*107699*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s010_010_son:0-750]]
What happened here?
*107700*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s010_020_kra:0-500]]
Shipwreck.
*107701*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s010_030_son:0-620]]
Well, yeah.
*107702*
[[S:::1100-2250]]
I wonder why it crashed?
*107703*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s010_040_son:110-950]]
That ship again…
*107704*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s010_050_son:0-2440]]
Wow, there was another shipwreck under the water.
*107705*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s010_060_son:0-1500]]
I wonder what happened to this ship’s crew?
*107706*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s015_010_son:0-2250]]
That’s some statue. Who built it, ya think?
*107707*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s015_020_kra:42-935]]
I do not know.
*107708*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s015_030_son:0-2000]]
The snake he’s holding… The World Serpent?
*107709*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s015_040_kra:0-500]]
Too small.
*107710*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s015_050_son:0-2750]]
Yea but… Maybe Thor is just REALLY big?
*107711*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s015_060_kra:30-1946]]
Mmm… Unlikely.
*107712*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s015_070_son:22-1276]]
I still can’t believe he ate it.
*107713*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s020_010_son:0-2250]]
That dragon… It’s Baldur’s, isn’t it?
*107714*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s020_020_kra:20-400]]
…Yes.
*107715*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s020_030_son:60-950]]
And you brought it down.
*107716*
[[S:::1490-2000]]
To save me?
*107717*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s020_040_mmr:0-1250]]
It was very heroic.
*107718*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s020_050_son:34-1275]]
Thank you, by the way.
*107719*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s020_060_kra:0-500]]
For what?
*107720*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s020_070_son:0-840]]
For saving me.
*107721*
[[S:::1800-5120]]
I… I know I screwed things up, before Baldur grabbed me.
*107722*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s020_080_kra:23-3865]]
Hmph. You did. But… you are my son.
*107723*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s025_010_son:40-1390]]
Hey, that looks like a water wheel.
*107724*
[[S:::1860-2760]]
Or, I guess…
*107725*
[[S:::3270-4190]]
an UNDER-water wheel.
*107726*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s025_020_kra:32-430]]
Hmph.
*107727*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s025_030_son:0-1160]]
Did you just… laugh at that?
*107728*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s025_040_kra:0-250]]
No.
*107729*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s025_050_son:40-704]]
Are you sure?
*107730*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s025_060_kra:70-620]]
Yes.
*107731*
[[S:::1010-2000]]
I do not laugh.
*107732*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s025_070_son:43-770]]
Don’t I know it.
*107733*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s025_080_son:30-1500]]
I bet the wheel could work if it wasn’t underwater.
*107734*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s025_090_son:0-530]]
Wow…
*107735*
[[S:::767-4539]]
there’s two of them! And they’re HUGE! I wonder why they aren’t moving?
*107736*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s030_010_son:100-660]]
Wow…
*107737*
[[S:::1110-2750]]
I’ve never seen a waterfall so big.
*107738*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s030_020_son:60-860]]
The waterfall… It
*107739*
[[S:::1290-2250]]
sure is beautiful.
*107740*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s030_030_son:0-2750]]
This waterfall is even bigger now that the water’s dropped.
*107741*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s030_040_son:80-2143]]
The waterfall… still beautiful.
*107742*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s035_010_son:25-821]]
Massive…
*107743*
[[S:::1120-2673]]
There must be a way to open this gate.
*107744*
[[S:::3140-3819]]
Somehow.
*107745*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s035_020_son:0-520]]
That gate…
*107746*
[[S:::970-1810]]
we should try to open it.
*107747*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s035_030_kra:90-300]]
Why?
*107748*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s035_040_son:0-3310]]
I mean… look at it! There’s gotta be something useful behind it.
*107749*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s035_050_son:40-570]]
That gate…
*107750*
[[S:::950-1950]]
we never did open it.
*107751*
[[S:::2380-3150]]
Should we give it a try?
*107752*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplclipoi_s035_060_kra:52-771]]
Hmpgh.
*107753*
[[S::vo_lvl_sindri1_s910_010_son_stem:1209-3588]]
We’re looking for a whetstone. Have you seen it?
*107754*
[[S:::10000-10982]]
What?
*107755*
[[S:::22572-24188]]
He killed his own father?
*107756*
[[S::vo_lvl_sindri1_s910_010_rvs_stem:3466-5931]]
Aye. There was one in this room.
*107757*
[[S:::6220-10582]]
My son sharpened his dagger on it, right before stabbing me in the back.
*107758*
[[S:::11090-14630]]
Little bastard thought it was his turn to lead my crew.
*107759*
[[S:::14840-16617]]
I was hard on him, sure,
*107760*
[[S:::17543-19379]]
(sighs). Guess I shouldn’t be surprised.
*107761*
[[S:::19651-22857]]
I did the same thing to my dad when I was his age.
*107762*
[[S:::28677-35081]]
Ha! He may be a bastard, but he’s MY bastard. You’ll get no help from me, fool.
*107763*
[[S:::36857-39873]]
Hey! That’s mine! HEY!
*107764*
[[S::vo_lvl_sindri1_s910_010_kra_stem:27520-28944]]
Where is he now?
*107765*
[[S:::34896-36986]]
Then his dagger will help.
*107766*
[[S:::39800-40350]]
Come boy
*107767*
[[S:::40940-42226]]
we are leaving,
*107768*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s005_010_sin:50-2500]]
You boys look like you’re gearing up for quite the journey…
*107769*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s007_010_sin:0-3250]]
I know of a place that may contain some useful treasure.
*107770*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s007_020_sin:0-1500]]
Any interest in checking it out?
*107771*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s010_010_sin:0-4857]]
There’s an abandoned temple in Midgard \nthat a fellow Dwarf converted to his personal storeroom.
*107772*
[[S:::5420-9327]]
Packed it with all sorts of treasures he collected during his travels throughout the realms.
*107773*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s010_020_son:0-780]]
Throughout the realms?
*107774*
[[S:::1390-2290]]
Which ones did he go to?
*107775*
[[S:::2820-3630]]
What did he collect?
*107776*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s010_020_son_a:0-770]]
Throughout the realms?
*107777*
[[S:::1430-2360]]
Which ones did he go to?
*107778*
[[S:::3020-3750]]
What did he collect?
*107779*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s010_030_sin:130-1030]]
Fafnir was a…
*107780*
[[S:::1650-7290]]
shall we say, “aggressive” collector of magical artefacts. The more he acquired, the more he desired.
*107781*
[[S:::7790-10770]]
There was no realm too dangerous, no relic too hazardous.
*107782*
[[S:::11270-14940]]
He once ventured deep into Niflheim for a whetstone, of all things!
*107783*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s010_040_sin:542-2860]]
Huh. I bet that was quite the whetstone…
*107784*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s010_050_kra:0-1854]]
Does this story have a point?
*107785*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s010_060_sin:20-1280]]
Yes it does!
*107786*
[[S:::1840-5270]]
I just happen to have an entry stone to Fafnir’s Storeroom!
*107787*
[[S:::5710-7250]]
You might find something useful in there.
*107788*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s010_070_son:0-370]]
Neat!
*107789*
[[S:::990-1610]]
Thanks Sindri!
*107790*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s010_080_sin:50-1060]]
You’re very welcome!
*107791*
[[S:::1420-4850]]
Oh, and… if you find that whetstone… well…
*107792*
[[S:::5330-7500]]
It sure would be nice of you to bring it to me!
*107793*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s020_010_sin:0-2550]]
I’d advise caution if you’re heading into the storeroom.
*107794*
[[S:::2771-6551]]
Last I was there, all manner of nastiness had taken up residence.
*107795*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s020_010_sin_a:0-2990]]
I’d advise caution if you’re heading into the storeroom.
*107796*
[[S:::3410-7910]]
I was there over a century ago, and all manner of nastiness had taken up residence.
*107797*
[[S:::8330-11750]]
Can’t imagine its become any cleaner after one hundred years of neglect.
*107798*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s020_020_son:31-1846]]
Won’t your friend be upset if we steal all his stuff?
*107799*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s020_030_sin:50-3310]]
Oh hahaha no, no not at all.
*107800*
[[S:::3980-4420]]
He’s dead. I think.
*107801*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s020_040_son:0-270]]
Oh…
*107802*
[[S:::810-1210]]
sorry.
*107803*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s020_050_sin:50-1667]]
No, no need to be sorry.
*107804*
[[S:::1858-7658]]
These things happen when one travels from realm to realm, collecting priceless artefacts that don’t belong to you.
*107805*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s025_010_son:0-1520]]
Treasures from all the different realms…
*107806*
[[S:::2000-3750]]
Do you think Fafnir went to Alfheim too?
*107807*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s025_020_kra:30-1000]]
I do not know.
*107808*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s025_030_son:1-2099]]
Aren’t you curious? He sounds interesting.
*107809*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s025_040_kra:0-3270]]
We go to this storeroom to collect anything useful for our journey.
*107810*
[[S:::3790-5750]]
Not to learn more about the dwarf.
*107811*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_sindri1_s025_050_mmr:0-2790]]
Fafnir WAS a rather interesting fellow, little brother.
*107812*
[[S:::3240-5000]]
Perhaps I’ll tell you his story one day.
*107813*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s030_010_kra:61-852]]
Reavers.
*107814*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s030_020_son:70-430]]
Uh oh.
*107815*
[[S:::900-2000]]
They must’ve gotten here first.
*107816*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s032_010_kra:0-2000]]
Locked. Find another entrance.
*107817*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s035_010_son:25-624]]
Whoah…
*107818*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s037_010_son:0-1570]]
Looks like the reavers made it inside.
*107819*
[[S:::2050-3450]]
I hope they didn’t take all the treasure…
*107820*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s040_010_son:0-1220]]
Just some stupid pots.
*107821*
[[S:::1570-2150]]
And draugr.
*107822*
[[S:::2680-4750]]
No magical treasure, and no whetstone.
*107823*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s040_020_kra:0-4000]]
Keep your expectations low, boy, and you will never be disappointed.
*107824*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s042_010_son:19-280]]
Ahh!
*107825*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s042_020_kra:50-1240]]
They caught you off-guard.
*107826*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s042_030_son:10-1022]]
I wasn’t expecting them!
*107827*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s042_040_kra:30-896]]
Exactly.
*107828*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s045_010_son:4-3059]]
There’s nothing but poison in this one. And a stupid bird statue.
*107829*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s045_020_kra:100-3730]]
AND useful resources; the main reason we are here, boy.
*107830*
[[S:::4360-4950]]
However…
*107831*
[[S:::5620-7250]]
many of these chests have been emptied.
*107832*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s045_030_son:740-1860]]
Probably by the Reavers…
*107833*
[[S:::2390-3800]]
I hope they didn’t take Sindri’s whetstone.
*107834*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s050_010_son:1-3655]]
I have a good feeling about this next one. Maybe we’ll even find the whetstone!
*107835*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s050_020_kra:30-2750]]
Remember what I told you about expectations, boy.
*107836*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s050_030_son:0-1350]]
“Keep them low,” I remember.
*107837*
[[S:::1860-3000]]
Still. Good feeling!
*107838*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s050_040_son:0-1000]]
So much for my good feeling.
*107839*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s050_050_kra:47-801]]
Mmm-hmm.
*107840*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s052_010_son:120-1250]]
I was ready for them, this time.
*107841*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s052_010_son_a:550-1750]]
I was ready for them, this time.
*107842*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s052_020_kra:50-500]]
I saw.
*107843*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s052_030_son:40-2200]]
So I should keep my expectations low,
*107844*
[[S:::2800-4000]]
but always expect an attack?
*107845*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s052_040_kra:51-7584]]
It is a delicate balance. Expect the worst. Assume nothing. And always anticipate an attack.
*107846*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s052_050_son:50-1250]]
Sure is a lot to remember.
*107847*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s055_010_son:520-1600]]
Still no whetstone.
*107848*
[[S:::2390-3650]]
And only one room left.
*107849*
[[S:::4660-5930]]
I know I shouldn’t hope, but…
*107850*
[[S:::6920-7930]]
do you think we’ll find it there?
*107851*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s055_020_kra:80-350]]
No.
*107852*
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s063_010_rvs:140-3250]]
Back to piss on my corpse? You ungrateful little –
*107853*
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s063_020_rvs:920-2000]]
Eh? Who are you two?
*107854*
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s063_030_rvs:150-1960]]
Fine, piss off then!
*107855*
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s063_040_rvs:98-4422]]
Hmph, you’re back. What do you lot want?
*107856*
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s064_010_rvs:120-450]]
Ha!
*107857*
[[S:::1160-2000]]
Choke on it!
*107858*
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s064_020_rvs:100-5655]]
Hmph. For a pair of pasty fífls, you sure can fight. I’ll give ya that.
*107859*
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s064_030_rvs:250-4840]]
What are you looking at?
*107860*
[[S:::4840-5750]]
Begone with yeh, or I’ll rip your legs off from beyond the grave, you dirty bastards.
*107861*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s065_010_son:0-6450]]
Why would his son betray him like that? Kill his own father? Over some treasure? It seems so greedy.
*107862*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s065_020_kra:160-1540]]
Remember what I told you, boy.
*107863*
[[S:::2670-3500]]
Assume nothing.
*107864*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s065_030_son:0-3466]]
Well—sure, he didn’t seem like a great father. But…
*107865*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s065_040_kra:71-1847]]
You only know half the story.
*107866*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s065_050_son:38-590]]
I guess…
*107867*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s072_010_sin:60-2000]]
Have you made it out to Fafnir’s Storeroom yet?
*107868*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s072_020_sin:70-3750]]
Poor Fafnir… There’s a fine line between ambition and greed, you know.
*107869*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s072_030_sin:160-3150]]
Found anything good in Fafnir’s storeroom? Like, maybe…
*107870*
[[S:::3520-4250]]
a whetstone?
*107871*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s072_040_sin:60-2380]]
Just make sure you watch each other’s backs in the storeroom.
*107872*
[[S:::2870-4750]]
Wouldn’t want to lose my loyal customers!
*107873*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s075_005_sin:100-2670]]
Well, what did you think of Fafnir’s Storeroom?
*107874*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s075_006_sin:46-3342]]
You… didn’t happen to find that whetstone, perchance?
*107875*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s075_010_kra:0-1340]]
We found no whetstone.
*107876*
[[S:::1890-4000]]
This dagger belongs to the Reaver who took it.
*107877*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s075_020_sin:20-1490]]
This sigil looks familiar…
*107878*
[[S:::2140-4000]]
Maybe I can figure out which clan it’s from?
*107879*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s075_030_son:28-1639]]
They took most of the good stuff.
*107880*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s075_040_sin:70-530]]
Oh?
*107881*
[[S:::880-3480]]
Well… Here, take this. In exchange for the dagger.
*107882*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s080_010_sin:50-6210]]
The dagger you brought me is quite interesting. An artless design, but the construction is sound.
*107883*
[[S:::6670-8420]]
Where in the temple did you find this?
*107884*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s080_020_son:23-933]]
In a Reaver’s back.
*107885*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s080_030_sin:108-2319]]
Ugh… Uuuughhhh…
*107886*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s080_040_son:20-1690]]
He mentioned he was part of a larger clan.
*107887*
[[S:::2300-3410]]
Maybe they took the whetstone?
*107888*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_sindri1_s080_050_sin:60-1210]]
Quite possibly.
*107889*
[[S:::2280-4250]]
I know I’ve seen this design before…
*107890*
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s095_010_rvs:360-5000]]
What are you fools doing back here? Come to pilfer my boots and small clothes?
*107891*
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s095_020_rvs:510-3900]]
I swear if I weren’t a ghost, I’d rip yer heart out through yer throat.
*107892*
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s095_030_rvs:230-1990]]
Are you just standing there to taunt me?
*107893*
[[S:::2350-3250]]
Begone with ye!
*107894*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s100_010_son:80-970]]
We found your son.
*107895*
[[S:::1790-2220]]
He…
*107896*
[[S:::3460-4450]]
he was betrayed, too.
*107897*
[[S:::5570-6760]]
And we found part of his journal.
*107898*
[[S:::7860-9500]]
It sounded like he regretted killing you.
*107899*
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s100_020_rvs:34-3178]]
Hmph. Fat lot of good that does me.
*107900*
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s100_030_rvs:170-1010]]
How’d he go out?
*107901*
[[S:::1850-2500]]
He die fighting?
*107902*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s100_040_kra:50-3250]]
We found four corpses near his. They were decapitated.
*107903*
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s100_050_rvs:455-1080]]
Ha!
*107904*
[[S:::1080-3730]]
Vandrid always did keep his sword nice and sharp…
*107905*
[[S:::4620-6000]]
A lesson he picked up from me.
*107906*
[[S:REAVER SPIRIT:vo_lvl_sindri1_s100_060_rvs:1050-2820]]
He’s a backstabbing bastard, but…
*107907*
[[S:::3900-5940]]
knowin’ he’s in Valhalla sets me at ease.
*107908*
[[S:::6930-7450]]
Thanks.
*107909*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s100_070_son:40-1050]]
We did a good thing!
*107910*
[[S:::1730-2850]]
I’m glad we came back here.
*107911*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s100_080_kra:140-2440]]
That thief did not deserve the peace you gave him.
*107912*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_sindri1_s100_090_son:60-670]]
Maybe so.
*107913*
[[S:::1380-1850]]
Still,
*107914*
[[S:::2590-3660]]
it feels good to help people.
*107915*
[[S:::4380-5070]]
Even the dead ones.
*107916*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s100_080_kra_a:0-2220]]
That thief did not deserve the peace you gave him.
*107917*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_sindri1_s100_100_kra:51-2227]]
Hmm. So much like your mother…
*107918*
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s005_005_trsp:72-1327]]
They’re all gone….
*107919*
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s005_010_trsp:50-780]]
Bjorn…
*107920*
[[S:::2030-2560]]
Iarl…
*107921*
[[S:::4260-5090]]
Vifil…
*107922*
[[S:::6520-7460]]
Hjorvarth…
*107923*
[[S:::9290-10000]]
Grimwald…
*107924*
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s010_010_trsp:30-740]]
Johan…
*107925*
[[S:::2600-3530]]
Thorvid…
*107926*
[[S:::5330-6170]]
Hallveig…
*107927*
[[S:::7330-8000]]
Solmund…
*107928*
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s010_020_trsp:20-860]]
Bothvar…
*107929*
[[S:::1670-2420]]
Frømund…
*107930*
[[S:::3920-4250]]
Eric…
*107931*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s015_010_kra:40-1000]]
What does it say, boy?
*107932*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s015_020_son:35-6480]]
Hmm… It doesn’t say anything, really. I think it’s more a symbol. Or maybe a brand.
*107933*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s015_020_son_a:39-6879]]
Hmm… It doesn’t say anything, really. I think it’s more a symbol. Or maybe a brand.
*107934*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s015_030_kra:40-1670]]
It must belong to the captain.
*107935*
[[S:::2180-3500]]
Keep watch for these in the lake.
*107936*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s020_010_son:340-1000]]
Are you okay?
*107937*
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s020_020_trsp:180-990]]
No, son.
*107938*
[[S:::2950-3760]]
My goods
*107939*
[[S:::4310-5360]]
are underwater.
*107940*
[[S:::6690-11310]]
My men are drowned. And yet, their bodies continue to walk the beaches.
*107941*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s020_030_kra:40-1090]]
Hel-Walkers.
*107942*
[[S:::1800-3000]]
They plague these lands.
*107943*
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s020_040_trsp:150-1240]]
I was their captain.
*107944*
[[S:::2730-4890]]
They died because of me.
*107945*
[[S:::7010-10200]]
But these abominations sully their memories.
*107946*
[[S:::11740-15530]]
I will find a way to free them from their tortured state.
*107947*
[[S:::15530-18080]]
In this, I am determined.
*107948*
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s025_010_trsp:0-3510]]
A thunderstorm scattered all three of my ships across the lake.
*107949*
[[S:::5030-7240]]
I know not what I did to anger Thor…
*107950*
[[S:::8500-10190]]
but his judgement was swift
*107951*
[[S:::10650-11190]]
and brutal.
*107952*
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s030_010_trsp:0-3247]]
I discovered opportunities for hunting and trade in these lands.
*107953*
[[S:::3476-6062]]
I gave up my search for Jötunheim long ago.
*107954*
[[S:::6992-9346]]
Leave that for the younger, more hopeful men.
*107955*
[[S:::10885-12641]]
But I was over-eager…
*107956*
[[S:::14085-16247]]
and my men paid a heavy price.
*107957*
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s030_020_trsp:210-3089]]
I felt blessed to lead such a loyal crew.
*107958*
[[S:::4489-6533]]
We’d become a family over the years.
*107959*
[[S:::7540-8229]]
And now...
*107960*
[[S:::9210-11496]]
my family is cursed.
*107961*
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s030_030_trsp:40-1270]]
I will not give up
*107962*
[[S:::1770-3250]]
until they are put to rest.
*107963*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s035_010_son:270-710]]
Boy,
*107964*
[[S:::1740-2500]]
what a sad story.
*107965*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s035_020_kra:630-1040]]
…Yes.
*107966*
[[S:::1990-2920]]
We should help him.
*107967*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s035_030_son:70-300]]
Really?
*107968*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s035_040_kra:40-1000]]
You are surprised.
*107969*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s035_050_son:0-400]]
Well,
*107970*
[[S:::1220-1770]]
yeah.
*107971*
[[S:::2730-4396]]
I didn’t think you’d care about helping a spirit.
*107972*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s035_060_kra:90-2400]]
Fighting more Hel-Walkers is good experience for you.
*107973*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s035_070_son:31-614]]
Oh.
*107974*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s040_010_son:670-2372]]
Were all those guys part of his crew?
*107975*
[[S:::3055-4280]]
That’s a tough crew.
*107976*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s040_020_kra:100-2040]]
And all were his responsibility.
*107977*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s040_030_son:35-1909]]
That’s a lot of responsibility.
*107978*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s040_040_kra:0-1109]]
Does it frighten you?
*107979*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s040_050_son:40-539]]
Uh…?
*107980*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s040_060_kra:50-1168]]
Responsibility.
*107981*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s040_070_son:120-1700]]
Oh. Uh, no.
*107982*
[[S:::2130-2850]]
I don’t think so.
*107983*
[[S:::3530-4022]]
I mean,
*107984*
[[S:::4350-5373]]
I think it used to.
*107985*
[[S:::5850-6890]]
But not as much anymore.
*107986*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s040_080_kra:60-797]]
Why is that?
*107987*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s040_090_son:30-483]]
Well,
*107988*
[[S:::870-1810]]
being out here…
*107989*
[[S:::2470-2982]]
with you…
*107990*
[[S:::3980-5150]]
It makes me feel more grown up.
*107991*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s040_100_kra:44-605]]
Hmm.
*107992*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s045_010_son:1226-2080]]
Seriously,
*107993*
[[S:::2770-4897]]
how did this one captain lead so many men?
*107994*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s045_020_kra:60-1165]]
He had their loyalty.
*107995*
[[S:::1420-2380]]
So they followed.
*107996*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s045_030_son:398-1606]]
And then they all died.
*107997*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s045_040_son:25-1351]]
He must’ve been a bad leader.
*107998*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s045_050_kra:40-1170]]
Why do you think that?
*107999*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s045_060_son:0-484]]
Well…
*108000*
[[S:::840-2443]]
he led all of these men to their deaths.
*108001*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s045_070_kra:0-520]]
True.
*108002*
[[S:::1150-2829]]
But these men chose to follow.
*108003*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s045_080_son:22-965]]
Hmm..
*108004*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s045_090_kra:45-2193]]
Even good leaders make poor choices.
*108005*
[[S:::2415-4529]]
The best take responsibility for them.
*108006*
[[S:::5246-6079]]
Remember this.
*108007*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s050_010_son:260-720]]
Father,
*108008*
[[S:::1850-3163]]
were you ever a leader?
*108009*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s050_020_kra:34-707]]
I…
*108010*
[[S:::1573-3079]]
Many years ago. Yes.
*108011*
[[S:::3660-5009]]
I led men in battle.
*108012*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s050_030_son:50-1665]]
Were you a good leader?
*108013*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s050_040_kra:229-1118]]
It is…
*108014*
[[S:::1428-2330]]
complicated.
*108015*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s050_050_son:30-670]]
Did you—
*108016*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s050_060_kra:0-1406]]
No more questions, boy.
*108017*
[[S:::1830-3246]]
Focus on the task at hand.
*108018*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s050_070_son:0-500]]
Yes, sir.
*108019*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s055_010_son:42-5553]]
Phew. That was the last ship. I hope the captain will be satisfied now.
*108020*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s055_020_kra:0-750]]
Unlikely.
*108021*
[[S:::1320-4000]]
He was determined to put these men to rest himself.
*108022*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s055_030_son:0-519]]
But…
*108023*
[[S:::780-2142]]
He would’ve never been able to.
*108024*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s055_040_kra:90-1450]]
That does not matter to him.
*108025*
[[S:::2040-4330]]
Our victory will only remind him of his failure.
*108026*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s055_050_son:130-669]]
Then…
*108027*
[[S:::1680-2690]]
why did we do this?
*108028*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s060_010_son:30-550]]
Father,
*108029*
[[S:::1920-3500]]
why did you really want to help this spirit?
*108030*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s060_020_kra:40-1428]]
You need the experience.
*108031*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s060_030_son:80-2420]]
I’ve had plenty of experience fighting these things!
*108032*
[[S:::3490-4500]]
What’s the real reason?
*108033*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s060_040_kra:47-865]]
Hmm…
*108034*
[[S:::1213-3042]]
this man inspired loyalty.
*108035*
[[S:::3492-5662]]
He took responsibility for his mistakes.
*108036*
[[S:::5909-7603]]
And he was determined to fix them.
*108037*
[[S:::8145-9356]]
These are good lessons for you.
*108038*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s060_050_son:15-318]]
Oh.
*108039*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s060_060_kra:36-572]]
Hmph.
*108040*
[[S:::865-1569]]
Yes.
*108041*
[[S:::2166-2645]]
“Oh.”
*108042*
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s065_010_trsp:0-380]]
My…
*108043*
[[S:::1070-1810]]
my men are…
*108044*
[[S:::2870-4500]]
They roam no longer?
*108045*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s070_010_son:50-700]]
That’s right!
*108046*
[[S:::1270-1740]]
We kille—
*108047*
[[S:::2150-2480]]
uh…
*108048*
[[S:::4140-5680]]
we laid them all to rest.
*108049*
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s070_020_trsp:120-830]]
I see…
*108050*
[[S:::2110-3501]]
So even in death,
*108051*
[[S:::4060-5208]]
I am a failure.
*108052*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s070_030_kra:70-1845]]
But in life, you were honourable.
*108053*
[[S:::2350-3260]]
Strong-willed.
*108054*
[[S:::3750-5265]]
And you inspired loyalty.
*108055*
[[S:::6370-7455]]
These are good qualities.
*108056*
[[S:::8250-9027]]
Aren’t they, boy?
*108057*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s070_040_son:29-581]]
Yeah.
*108058*
[[S:::1510-3556]]
I couldn’t believe how many men followed you here!
*108059*
[[S:TRADESMAN SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s070_050_trsp:57-570]]
I…
*108060*
[[S:::1370-3320]]
Thank you for your kind words.
*108061*
[[S:::4780-7060]]
May your journey have a more pleasant end
*108062*
[[S:::7670-8250]]
than mine.
*108063*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s075_010_son:40-579]]
Well,
*108064*
[[S:::1375-2026]]
you were right.
*108065*
[[S:::3102-4490]]
He didn’t seem very satisfied.
*108066*
[[S:::6051-8660]]
I guess you never really get over losing the ones you care about.
*108067*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s075_020_kra:52-747]]
Hmnph.
*108068*
[[S:::1152-1690]]
Never.
*108069*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdf_s075_020_kra_a:0-590]]
No.
*108070*
[[S:::1140-1670]]
Never.
*108071*
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s005_010_spvl:0-863]]
Gullveig…
*108072*
[[S:::2916-5309]]
You were taken from this realm too early.
*108073*
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s010_010_spvl:560-2120]]
You will be whole again…
*108074*
[[S:::2820-3850]]
This I swear.
*108075*
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s010_020_spvl:40-1280]]
Midgard suffers…
*108076*
[[S:::2130-4500]]
deprived of your power, my dear Gullveig…
*108077*
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s010_030_spvl:14-2381]]
I will not rest until you are complete!
*108078*
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s015_010_spvl:40-1960]]
You, who walks among the living!
*108079*
[[S:::2560-4610]]
My beloved Gullveig calls to me…
*108080*
[[S:::5070-6650]]
she yearns for peace!
*108081*
[[S:::7260-9390]]
Yet her remains lie in pieces.
*108082*
[[S:::9940-13000]]
I beg of you, make my Gullveig whole again!
*108083*
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s015_010_spvl_a:180-2010]]
You, who walks among the living!
*108084*
[[S:::2510-4620]]
My beloved Gullveig calls to me…
*108085*
[[S:::5150-7160]]
I can hear her scattered bones.
*108086*
[[S:::7650-9370]]
They sing with anguish!
*108087*
[[S:::10240-10990]]
I beg of you,
*108088*
[[S:::11620-13250]]
make my Gullveig whole again!
*108089*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s015_020_son:200-1820]]
You want us to collect her bones?
*108090*
[[S:::2600-3000]]
Gross.
*108091*
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s015_030_spvl:60-2900]]
Gullveig’s seiðr magick knows no bounds.
*108092*
[[S:::3480-5750]]
She can reunite you with those you’ve lost!
*108093*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s015_040_son:0-501]]
Really?
*108094*
[[S:::1070-1655]]
How?
*108095*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s015_050_kra:46-826]]
Boy…
*108096*
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s015_060_spvl:170-1930]]
I can smell your grief, child.
*108097*
[[S:::2720-7990]]
Rest assured, her magic is strong enough to create bridges between life and death…
*108098*
[[S:::8510-10000]]
if only for a short while.
*108099*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s015_070_kra:70-430]]
Boy!
*108100*
[[S:::840-1500]]
We are leaving.
*108101*
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s020_010_spvl:110-4500]]
They’ve taken three of sweet Gullveig’s bones, and spread them across the lake.
*108102*
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s020_020_spvl:40-3250]]
Bring me her bones, child! Gullveig will reward you!
*108103*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s025_010_son:50-690]]
Father…
*108104*
[[S:::1700-3500]]
maybe we should look for those bones?
*108105*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s025_020_kra:0-488]]
Why.
*108106*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s025_030_son:137-855]]
Didn’t you hear him?
*108107*
[[S:::1552-4677]]
We could talk to Mom again. If we keep an eye out while we—
*108108*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s025_040_kra:40-1330]]
Look if you wish, boy!
*108109*
[[S:::1790-4000]]
I will not be distracted by this fool’s errand.
*108110*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s027_010_son:30-720]]
Do you hear that?
*108111*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s027_020_son:24-938]]
What is that sound?
*108112*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s027_030_son:80-430]]
Is that…
*108113*
[[S:::940-1500]]
singing?
*108114*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s027_040_son:29-1426]]
That sounds like one of her bones!
*108115*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s027_050_son:30-1400]]
I think I hear a bone nearby…
*108116*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s027_060_son:0-1000]]
You hear that too, right?
*108117*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s027_070_son:30-1000]]
I hear a bone singing!
*108118*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s030_010_kra:44-1749]]
These bones pulse with magic…
*108119*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s030_020_son:46-1293]]
It must be Gullveig!
*108120*
[[S:::1954-2485]]
Could we…
*108121*
[[S:::3432-4500]]
could we just hold onto it?
*108122*
[[S:::5388-6511]]
Maybe we’ll find the rest of them.
*108123*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s030_030_kra:0-1250]]
This Spirit lies to you, boy.
*108124*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s030_040_son:0-500]]
How would you know?
*108125*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s030_050_kra:0-1550]]
I have known many spirits.
*108126*
[[S:::2010-3250]]
They are all liars.
*108127*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s030_060_son:0-830]]
This one is different.
*108128*
[[S:::1220-1650]]
I know it.
*108129*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s030_070_kra:20-1250]]
You “know” very little.
*108130*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s032_010_kra:90-3335]]
Trusting a spirit to keep its word is foolish, boy.
*108131*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s032_020_son:49-503]]
But,
*108132*
[[S:::955-2340]]
if there’s even a chance…
*108133*
[[S:::3110-4154]]
Don’t you want to see Mom again?
*108134*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s032_050_kra:39-1017]]
Of course I—
*108135*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s032_060_kra:0-2030]]
She is gone, Atreus.
*108136*
[[S:::2720-4000]]
You must accept this.
*108137*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s032_060_kra_a:0-1240]]
She is gone, Atreus.
*108138*
[[S:::1870-3195]]
You must accept this.
*108139*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s032_070_son:0-870]]
I do, but…
*108140*
[[S:::1520-2460]]
to see her again,
*108141*
[[S:::3080-4496]]
just one more time…
*108142*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s032_080_kra:30-1330]]
Why do you believe him?
*108143*
[[S:::1840-3890]]
You do not know him, or who he was.
*108144*
[[S:::4780-6250]]
All of this is sinister.
*108145*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s032_080_kra_a:30-1050]]
Why do you believe him?
*108146*
[[S:::1960-4181]]
You do not know him, or who he was.
*108147*
[[S:::4590-5793]]
All of this is sinister.
*108148*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s032_090_son:150-1880]]
He wants to see someone he loved again.
*108149*
[[S:::2410-2816]]
I…
*108150*
[[S:::3820-5320]]
I understand how that feels.
*108151*
[[S:::6670-8562]]
I don’t think there’s anything sinister about it.
*108152*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s032_100_kra:0-2707]]
Hope is blinding your instincts, boy.
*108153*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s032_100_kra_a:80-2295]]
Hope is blinding your instincts, boy.
*108154*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s035_020_son:37-1196]]
Gullveig’s bones.
*108155*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s035_040_kra:0-1210]]
What will you say to her?
*108156*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s035_041_son:90-750]]
To Gullveig?
*108157*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s035_042_kra:0-570]]
Your mother.
*108158*
[[S:::1700-2750]]
What have you left unsaid?
*108159*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s035_043_son:60-450]]
I…
*108160*
[[S:::1180-2090]]
I guess
*108161*
[[S:::3570-5000]]
I… I just want to know if she’s okay.
*108162*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s035_044_kra:60-1000]]
She is dead, boy.
*108163*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s035_045_son:252-1333]]
I know that! I…
*108164*
[[S:::3310-4320]]
You don’t understand.
*108165*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s035_046_kra:0-910]]
Neither do you.
*108166*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s037_010_son:120-1250]]
What would you say to Mom?
*108167*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s037_020_kra:14-802]]
Nothing.
*108168*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s037_030_son:30-714]]
Nothing?
*108169*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s037_040_kra:0-1705]]
There is nothing left to say.
*108170*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s037_050_son:90-1828]]
What about everything we’ve done so far?
*108171*
[[S:::2770-4140]]
That man coming to the house…
*108172*
[[S:::4900-6314]]
Talking to the World Serpent…
*108173*
[[S:::6978-8749]]
We’ve done so many amazing things…

[[S:::10176-11583]]
I just want to tell her about them.

[[S:::2670-4100]]
Talking to the World Serpent…
*108177*
[[S:::4600-5550]]
Going to Alfheim…
*108178*
[[S:::6627-8107]]
we even killed a dragon!

Don’t you?

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s037_100_kra:0-1250]]
What else would you say to her?

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s037_100_kra_a:0-1250]]
What else would you say to her?
*108190*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s037_110_son:50-1394]]
I’d tell her that we’re both okay.

Not to worry about us.

[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s037_120_kra:70-1140]]
Atreus, I…
*108193*
[[S:::1780-2862]]
I miss her too.
*108194*
[[S:::3170-3989]]
You know this.
*108195*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s037_130_son:160-2000]]
I thought I “knew very little.”
*108196*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s040_010_kra:50-750]]
The final bone.
*108197*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s040_020_son:31-654]]
Yeah.
*108198*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s040_030_kra:0-2030]]
We might as well return them to the Spirit.
*108199*
[[S:::2800-4500]]
Maybe he will keep his word, and–
*108200*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s040_040_son:54-2099]]
I know she’s not coming back, okay!
*108201*
[[S:::2862-3514]]
I know.
*108202*
[[S:::4084-4578]]
I just…
*108203*
[[S:::5708-6411]]
Nevermind.
*108204*
[[S:::8521-9954]]
(sighs) Let’s just go return the bones.
*108205*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s065_010_son:60-2250]]
I wonder why Gullveig’s bones are all over the place?
*108206*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s065_020_mmr:0-1390]]
For desecration, typically.
*108207*
[[S:::1820-4620]]
Pieces of scattered corpse make for a piss poor soul.
*108208*
[[S:::5280-9430]]
No hope for Valhalla or Helheim when your arm’s on one beach and your head’s on another.
*108209*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s065_030_kra:80-1440]]
Why not ask the Spirit?
*108210*
[[S:::1930-4500]]
I am sure he will be forthcoming with answers.
*108211*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s070_010_son:38-3861]]
Spirit, why are Gullveig’s bones scattered around these beaches?
*108212*
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s070_020_spvl:130-600]]
She was…
*108213*
[[S:::1210-2040]]
too pure.
*108214*
[[S:::2720-4090]]
Too beautiful. Too…
*108215*
[[S:::5440-5850]]
too…
*108216*
[[S:::6970-7610]]
charming.
*108217*
[[S:::8510-10710]]
She inspired great jealousy amongst others,
*108218*
[[S:::11470-13150]]
and they desecrated her poor body.
*108219*
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s075_010_spvl:20-620]]
Please!
*108220*
[[S:::1420-2570]]
My fair Gullveig…
*108221*
[[S:::3450-5500]]
this realm suffers without her spirit.
*108222*
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s075_020_spvl:80-3250]]
Gullveig’s magic can help you, child! Find her!
*108223*
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s075_030_spvl:60-1710]]
They are searching for you, Gullveig…
*108224*
[[S:::2330-4750]]
You will soon show them the power of the Seiðr…
*108225*
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s075_040_spvl:80-2500]]
Her bones, child! Find her bones!
*108226*
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s075_050_spvl:0-3000]]
Gullveig will show you… She will reunite you….
*108227*
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s075_060_spvl:460-2190]]
Once Gullveig is reborn,
*108228*
[[S:::3070-4750]]
I may finally know rest.
*108229*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s080_010_kra:90-2660]]
We have collected the rest of your woman’s corpse, Spirit.
*108230*
[[S:::3240-5000]]
Show us this magic you have promised.
*108231*
[[S:VÀLAÐR:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s080_020_spvl:120-500]]
Ahhh!
*108232*
[[S:::1700-3160]]
My sweet Gullveig…
*108233*
[[S:::3780-4740]]
whole again.
*108234*
[[S:::5820-7220]]
Rise, dear Gullveig.
*108235*
[[S:::7930-10700]]
AWAKEN, OH POWERFUL GULLVEIG!
*108236*
[[S:GULLVEIG:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s080_030_gul:3-3068]]
Evni ykkarr biðjast…
*108237*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s080_040_son:130-1900]]
She says she will honour our request!
*108238*
[[S:GULLVEIG:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s080_050_gul:2-2305]]
Eldi-fagnað…
*108239*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s080_060_son:55-1302]]
And reunite us…
*108240*
[[S:GULLVEIG:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s080_070_gul:410-1450]]
Inn dauðr!!!
*108241*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s080_080_son:32-838]]
Uh oh.
*108242*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s080_090_kra:40-477]]
What?
*108243*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s080_100_son:40-610]]
OK…
*108244*
[[S:::1020-1540]]
You were right.
*108245*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s085_010_son:50-550]]
Alright.
*108246*
[[S:::1290-2000]]
Say it.
*108247*
[[S:::3020-3750]]
“I told you so.”
*108248*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s085_020_kra:90-1000]]
I told you so.
*108249*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s085_030_son:0-1250]]
“You are a naïve, foolish boy.”
*108250*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s085_040_kra:0-1130]]
This is true as well.
*108251*
[[S:::1820-4300]]
But do not take your disappointment out on me, boy.
*108252*
[[S:::4890-5750]]
Take it as a lesson.
*108253*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubdm_s085_050_son:21-765]]
Yes, sir.
*108254*
[[S:SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s005_010_sprtr:0-2250]]
Come and face me, God of Thunder!
*108255*
[[S:SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s005_020_sprtr:0-3250]]
I will not rest until you pay for what you’ve done!
*108256*
[[S:SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s005_030_sprtr:0-1820]]
Are you too scared to fight me?
*108257*
[[S:::2240-2980]]
Coward!
*108258*
[[S:SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s010_010_sprtr:260-2236]]
Face me, God of Thunder!
*108259*
[[S:SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s010_020_sprtr:31-908]]
Coward!
*108260*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s015_010_kra:0-2670]]
Your challenges mean nothing to the gods, spirit.
*108261*
[[S:::3260-4000]]
They do not listen.
*108262*
[[S:SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s015_020_sprtr:0-1590]]
Do not mock my pursuit of vengeance.
*108263*
[[S:::2230-6380]]
Though my family devoted their lives to worshipping Thor, I’ve devoted mine to his downfall.
*108264*
[[S:::7270-10000]]
And I will start with that statue looming over my father’s grave.
*108265*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s015_030_kra:0-850]]
Unlikely.
*108266*
[[S:::1400-2000]]
You are dead.
*108267*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s015_040_son:39-1227]]
Is there something we can do?
*108268*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s015_045_kra:0-1250]]
—for a reward, of course.
*108269*
[[S:SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s015_050_sprtr:180-1800]]
If you bring down the statue,
*108270*
[[S:::2540-4910]]
you have my blessing to loot my father’s grave.
*108271*
[[S:::5930-8000]]
He rests on an island to the east.
*108272*
[[S:SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s015_050_sprtr_a:180-1800]]
If you bring down the statue,
*108273*
[[S:::2540-4910]]
you have my blessing to loot my father’s grave.
*108274*
[[S:::5920-7750]]
He rests on an island near here.
*108275*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s020_010_son:0-1250]]
Why do you hate Thor so much?
*108276*
[[S:SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s020_020_sprtr:90-4050]]
After my father passed, my mother built the statue to watch over his grave.
*108277*
[[S:::4700-8250]]
Imagine our surprise when the God of Thunder himself came to offer condolences!
*108278*
[[S:SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s020_021_sprtr:0-1160]]
At first we were thrilled,
*108279*
[[S:::1520-3850]]
but he quickly took advantage of our hospitality.
*108280*
[[S:::4370-8850]]
My mother begged him to leave, and Thor, in his drunken rage, killed her.
*108281*
[[S:SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s020_022_sprtr:0-1530]]
I was left with nothing but grief.
*108282*
[[S:::2370-4320]]
Eventually, I lost that as well…
*108283*
[[S:::4880-6750]]
and found only rage in its place.
*108284*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s020_030_son:0-2010]]
I… I’m so sorry.
*108285*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s020_040_kra:0-2000]]
Come boy. We have a statue to destroy.
*108286*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s023_010_son:0-3090]]
Father, didn’t the spirit say it was the other statue of Thor?
*108287*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s025_010_kra:37-966]]
That spirit…
*108288*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s025_020_son:0-1580]]
The one whose Mom was killed by Thor?
*108289*
[[S:::1930-2430]]
What about him?
*108290*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s025_030_kra:0-1580]]
Let his story be a reminder.
*108291*
[[S:::2030-3990]]
The lives of Men mean nothing to the gods.
*108292*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s025_040_son:0-670]]
I know, father.
*108293*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s025_050_kra:130-780]]
“You know.”
*108294*
[[S:::1450-2410]]
But do you listen?
*108295*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s025_060_son:23-903]]
Yes.
*108296*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s025_070_kra:41-1112]]
Hrm. Good.
*108297*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s030_010_son:40-630]]
That island…
*108298*
[[S:::1060-2500]]
Is that another statue of Thor?
*108299*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s030_020_son:48-4088]]
There’s a Thor statue on that island… That must be where the spirit’s father is buried.
*108300*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s035_010_son:40-1240]]
Well, here it is.
*108301*
[[S:::1780-2930]]
It’s gotta have a weak point,
*108302*
[[S:::3480-4000]]
somewhere…
*108303*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s035_040_son:0-710]]
There it goes!
*108304*
[[S:::1160-2750]]
How was he planning on doing this himself?
*108305*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s035_050_son:16-1616]]
It looks about ready to topple over.
*108306*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s035_060_son:30-1630]]
Take that, Thor! Ha,
*108307*
[[S:::2400-3440]]
he wasn’t so tough.
*108308*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s035_070_kra:50-2250]]
Gods do not fall this easily, boy.
*108309*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s035_080_son:0-1750]]
I know, I know. I was just joking.
*108310*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s035_090_kra:0-1420]]
Nor are they a joking matter.
*108311*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s035_100_son:8-487]]
Sorry.
*108312*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s040_010_son:0-2000]]
His father’s grave. Find anything good?
*108313*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s040_020_kra:30-672]]
Perhaps…
*108314*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s040_030_son:3-2877]]
Father… we’re going to bring down that statue… right?
*108315*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s040_040_son:25-2008]]
We’re really just going to loot his grave and leave?!
*108316*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s045_010_son:50-590]]
Father,
*108317*
[[S:::1150-3000]]
why do the gods cause so much trouble for us?
*108318*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s045_020_son:0-550]]
Father,
*108319*
[[S:::1200-3250]]
why do the gods cause so much trouble for mortals?
*108320*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s045_030_kra:30-1750]]
Because that is their nature.
*108321*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s045_040_son:80-370]]
But…
*108322*
[[S:::740-1730]]
with all that power…
*108323*
[[S:::2210-5000]]
You would think at least SOME of them would try to make life better for people.
*108324*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s045_050_kra:80-2810]]
And yet, the gods continue to spread misery.
*108325*
[[S:::3450-4500]]
This is life, boy.
*108326*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s045_060_son:40-4198]]
Hmm. Well, at least WE’RE doing some good, right?
*108327*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s045_070_kra:29-356]]
Hmph.
*108328*
[[S:SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s050_010_sprtr:0-2710]]
My father’s grave lies on an island to the east.
*108329*
[[S:::4140-8250]]
Do not mistake my mother’s statue of Thor with that monstrous eyesore to the south.
*108330*
[[S:SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s050_010_sprtr_a:0-2720]]
My father’s grave lies on an island near here.
*108331*
[[S:::4390-9000]]
Do not mistake my mother’s statue of Thor with that monstrous eyesore in the lake.
*108332*
[[S:SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s050_020_sprtr:0-2900]]
My father was buried with a valuable family heirloom.
*108333*
[[S:::4620-5470]]
It is yours,
*108334*
[[S:::5990-6750]]
if you help me.
*108335*
[[S:SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s050_030_sprtr:30-3750]]
I cannot rest while my mother’s murderer stands above my father’s grave.
*108336*
[[S:SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s055_010_sprtr:0-490]]
You there!
*108337*
[[S:::1240-2460]]
Have you destroyed the statue?
*108338*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s060_010_kra:0-2250]]
The statue stands no longer, Spirit.
*108339*
[[S:SPIRIT:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s060_020_sprtr:30-1780]]
Then my bond to this realm is severed,
*108340*
[[S:::2560-4810]]
and I am off to find the real God of Thunder.
*108341*
[[S:::6050-7290]]
He will know retribution.
*108342*
[[S:::8920-10000]]
My deepest gratitude.
*108343*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s060_030_son:20-840]]
Off he goes.
*108344*
[[S:::1600-3820]]
Brave guy, going to look for Thor on his own.
*108345*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplubtr_s060_040_kra:36-1235]]
He is a fool.
*108346*
[[S::vo_lvl_xplhm2_s920_010_brk_stem:2210-3790]]
Talk to this here ring.
*108347*
[[S:::11420-12560]]
Ha! Knew it.
*108348*
[[S:::27210-28680]]
What about all his stuff?
*108349*
[[S:::31170-37300]]
Andvari had a workshop here with all sorts a posh doo-dads and ornatery tools.
*108350*
[[S:::37300-39070]]
And one beaut of a hammer!
*108351*
[[S:::39640-41690]]
He make mention if it still in there?
*108352*
[[S:::46320-47080]]
…Yer point?
*108353*
[[S:::49690-53120]]
You fellers take Andvari with you and go have a look-see.
*108354*
[[S:::53710-58640]]
If’n you find his hammer, I’ll whip up something REAL nice fer ya!
*108355*
[[S:::63860-67140]]
Hey now, don’t go forgettin’ your Entry Stone!
*108356*
[[S::vo_lvl_xplhm2_s920_010_son_stem:3940-4790]]
Uh, what?
*108357*
[[S:::5440-7050]]
I can’t hear thoughts from rings, Brok.
*108358*
[[S:::8860-11160]]
It’s talking to me! It’s Andvari!
*108359*
[[S:::13660-16000]]
He says he went to the Völunder Mines to,
*108360*
[[S:::16950-17890]]
“…observe his mistake.”?
*108361*
[[S:::19030-20140]]
But then the Soul Eater attacked.
*108362*
[[S:::21020-26070]]
So as he was being ripped apart, he cast a spell that removed his soul and put it in this ring!
*108363*
[[S:::26800-27430]]
And then he—
*108364*
[[S:::29160-30780]]
Uh…huh?
*108365*
[[S:::43530-45280]]
Ohh…you’re upsetting him.
*108366*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s010_010_brk:290-3000]]
Ho there! Got another favour to ask you two.
*108367*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s011_010_brk:0-2970]]
Don’tcha got nothing in your shriveled hearts for Brok?
*108368*
[[S:::3530-4750]]
I got needs.
*108369*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s011_020_brk:0-3250]]
Help me and I might fry up a sausage for you.
*108370*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s015_010_kra:60-1250]]
What do you want, Dwarf?
*108371*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s015_020_brk:0-2910]]
I got another lead on my ol’ pal Andvari.
*108372*
[[S:::3330-8620]]
Meet me at the Landsuther Mines? There’s sum fancy-dancy loot in it for you.
*108373*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s015_030_son:100-850]]
Another lead?
*108374*
[[S:::1650-2500]]
But we already found him.
*108375*
[[S:::3250-5000]]
Well… found his hand, anyways.
*108376*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s015_040_brk:0-1800]]
I’ll explain at the Mines.
*108377*
[[S:::2190-8060]]
These ones is just south of the River Pass. Now you two want somethin’, or you just gonna stand
*108378*
[[S:::8060-9900]]
there, all gag-scrapped and slack-jawed?
*108379*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s017_010_brk:0-1750]]
Well, lookey who decided to show?
*108380*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s017_020_brk:0-5250]]
Sure, keep yer ol’ pal Brok waitin, not like he’s got nuthin’ better to do!
*108381*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s018_010_brk:0-6380]]
Pulled the ring offa Andvari’s hand at the Völunder Mines. Feller was always tamperin’ with souls,
*108382*
[[S:::6380-8500]]
and dark rituals and matters of the night, see?
*108383*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s018_020_brk:0-5350]]
Just the sound of his hammer flattenin’ metal were enough to stoke my fires all blissful.
*108384*
[[S:::6810-9500]]
Shit, you better clear out a’fore I get all frisky.
*108385*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s019_010_brk:0-1500]]
You two goin’ in or what?
*108386*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s019_020_brk:60-2750]]
What’s got you all bumfuzzled over there? Get goin’!
*108387*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s020_010_son:45-2246]]
Andvari isn’t happy about us taking his stuff.
*108388*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s020_020_kra:30-750]]
I do not care.
*108389*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s020_020_kra_a:70-1000]]
I do not care.
*108390*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s020_030_son:50-3000]]
He says that a hive of Dark Ones moved in after he and his crew left.
*108391*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s020_040_kra:25-1569]]
That does not concern me.
*108392*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s020_042_son:67-1096]]
I’m not gonna tell him that!
*108393*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s025_010_son:140-2140]]
Andvari says this dwarf was part of his crew.
*108394*
[[S:::2880-4490]]
That he died because of his mistakes.
*108395*
[[S:::6020-6640]]
He sounds…
*108396*
[[S:::7370-7750]]
sad.
*108397*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s025_020_kra:60-2250]]
The ring’s grief is of little importance, boy.
*108398*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s030_010_son:70-1730]]
Oohh… he did not like that.
*108399*
[[S:::2340-3750]]
He’s warning us not to go down there.
*108400*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s030_020_kra:60-3250]]
Stop listening to the ring, boy. It cannot be trusted.
*108401*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s035_010_son:180-2250]]
He says this chest will trigger a bunch of traps.
*108402*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s035_020_kra:80-980]]
I see no traps.
*108403*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s035_030_son:30-1450]]
He sounded so sure about it…
*108404*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s035_050_son:0-750]]
Yeah, right.
*108405*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s040_010_kra:58-1652]]
Silence that ring, boy!
*108406*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s040_020_son:20-800]]
I don’t know how!
*108407*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s045_010_son:100-1000]]
A Soul Eater…
*108408*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s045_020_kra:320-1040]]
And a Traveller.
*108409*
[[S:::1650-2250]]
Guard up.
*108410*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s050_010_son:26-2012]]
Hmm… a dead Soul Eater…
*108411*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s050_011_son:0-1600]]
What’s a Soul Eater even doing here?
*108412*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s050_020_son:26-1550]]
What do you mean, “It’s your fault”?
*108413*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s050_030_kra:60-1450]]
Boy. Ignore him.
*108414*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s050_040_son:26-1820]]
It’s sort of tough for me to ignore.
*108415*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s055_010_son:120-1820]]
Andvari says his workshop is up there.
*108416*
[[S:::2700-3880]]
But, I know, I know…
*108417*
[[S:::4660-5500]]
don’t trust a talking ring.
*108418*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s060_010_kra:99-971]]
Boy…
*108419*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s060_020_son:0-1800]]
Father, please. Just listen.
*108420*
[[S:::2300-4050]]
Andvari’s crew did something bad here.
*108421*
[[S:::4050-7460]]
He’s glad you destroyed his lab, and he’s sorry he kept trying to trick us.
*108422*
[[S:::7930-9350]]
His hammer is just through this gate.
*108423*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s060_030_son:41-918]]
Can we keep him?
*108424*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s060_040_kra:780-2250]]
We will talk to the blue one.
*108425*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s065_010_kra:58-2671]]
Hrmm… This is a fine hammer.
*108426*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s065_020_son:53-1164]]
Andvari says, thank you!
*108427*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s070_010_brk:0-4500]]
You two find that hammer? Or you too busy lootin’ every keyhole and cranny?
*108428*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s070_020_brk:44-3282]]
Well, don’t just stand there, you pimple-drippers! What’d ya find?!
*108429*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s071_010_brk:50-1250]]
How did it go in there?
*108430*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s071_020_brk:0-1750]]
You two find that hammer or not?
*108431*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s075_010_kra:320-660]]
Here.
*108432*
[[S:::1120-2210]]
The Alchemist’s Hammer.
*108433*
[[S:::2760-4000]]
His spirit is a nuisance.
*108434*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s075_020_brk:80-510]]
Ha!
*108435*
[[S:::1030-3310]]
Andvari always was an asshole.
*108436*
[[S:::3880-5300]]
Helluvan Alchemist though.
*108437*
[[S:::5800-7750]]
Hand him over and I’ll melt him down.
*108438*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s075_030_son:44-2408]]
What? You’re going to melt down your friend?
*108439*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s075_040_brk:140-3880]]
A trapped soul’s what I need to give your reward some extra oomph.
*108440*
[[S:::4640-5410]]
You don’t want it?
*108441*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s075_050_son:50-5630]]
Father… we can’t do that! Here, you hold onto him. He’s really useful, I promise!
*108442*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s075_060_kra:95-4252]]
(resigned sigh)…  Fine. So long as he proves his worth.
*108443*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhm2_s080_010_brk:140-2030]]
Kid’s a bit of a softy, eh?
*108444*
[[S:::2750-4400]]
Well, he’ll grow out of it.
*108445*
[[S::vo_lvl_sindri2_s930_010_kra_stem:20640-21680]]
This is the son.
*108446*
[[S:::25680-26380]]
This sigil.
*108447*
[[S:::26820-29440]]
It matches the dagger we found in his father’s back.
*108448*
[[S:::30050-32180]]
He stood his ground, but it was not enough.
*108449*
[[S:::46840-48490]]
He thought himself ready to lead.
*108450*
[[S:::49230-50190]]
It cost him his life.
*108451*
[[S:::60140-60790]]
Yes.
*108452*
[[S:::61230-62940]]
They used it to smash his face in.
*108453*
[[S::vo_lvl_sindri2_s930_010_son_stem:23100-25200]]
That ghost’s son? How do you know?
*108454*
[[S:::37480-38300]]
They betrayed him…
*108455*
[[S:::51200-51940]]
…I guess…
*108456*
[[S:::56480-57300]]
The whetstone!
*108457*
[[S:::63407-65140]]
They did? Ew…
*108458*
[[S::vo_lvl_sindri2_s930_010_mmr_stem:39080-40680]]
Betrayal begets betrayal.
*108459*
[[S:::41050-44760]]
My guess, the young one murdering his da’ didn’t sit well with the others.
*108460*
[[S:::53220-54630]]
Look there, lad. By his feet.
*108461*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplsh_s005_010_sin:0-3000]]
I have more information on that whetstone I mentioned earlier…
*108462*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplsh_s007_010_sin:70-2490]]
I have a favour to ask. Just a small favour, really.
*108463*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplsh_s007_020_sin:30-2750]]
I’d happily reward you for looking into this for me.
*108464*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplsh_s010_010_sin:0-1780]]
Do you remember the dagger you gave me?
*108465*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplsh_s010_020_son:80-1740]]
The dagger stabbed into the reaver’s back?
*108466*
[[S:::2440-3460]]
Whose own son killed him?
*108467*
[[S:::4100-4390]]
Yea,
*108468*
[[S:::5000-6000]]
I haven’t forgotten that one.
*108469*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplsh_s010_030_sin:110-580]]
Well,
*108470*
[[S:::980-6320]]
I traced it to a group of Reavers that operate out of the Northri Stronghold. I’d wager that’s
*108471*
[[S:::6320-8610]]
where they took their haul from Fafnir’s Storeroom.
*108472*
[[S:::9130-10690]]
Along with that whetstone…
*108473*
[[S:::11330-12590]]
that I could use…
*108474*
[[S:::13400-14250]]
to help you?
*108475*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplsh_s010_040_kra:106-1450]]
Hrnnn.
*108476*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplsh_s015_010_kra:170-1440]]
Another treasure hunt.
*108477*
[[S:::2180-2750]]
Pointless.
*108478*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplsh_s015_020_son:50-550]]
Well,
*108479*
[[S:::1040-4130]]
not if Sindri really can make us better equipment with that whetstone.
*108480*
[[S:::4660-5170]]
Plus…
*108481*
[[S:::5650-6540]]
the reaver’s son.
*108482*
[[S:::6950-8250]]
He MURDERED his father!
*108483*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplsh_s020_010_sin:40-4080]]
Once you retrieve the whetstone, please take utmost care while handling it.
*108484*
[[S:::4440-6750]]
It is a priceless relic, after all.
*108485*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplsh_s030_010_son:35-5087]]
I still can’t believe a son would kill his own father. That’s crazy, right?
*108486*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplsh_s030_020_son:40-2290]]
I know… We only got one side of the story,
*108487*
[[S:::3140-4550]]
but come on!
*108488*
[[S:::4550-8750]]
His own father? I mean… I get angry at you sometimes, but—
*108489*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplsh_s030_030_kra:50-1005]]
Do you?
*108490*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplsh_s030_030_kra_a:50-750]]
Do you?
*108491*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplsh_s030_040_son:0-400]]
I mean,
*108492*
[[S:::1130-2990]]
sometimes, yeah, a little.
*108493*
[[S:::4000-5400]]
But I’d never stab you in the back.
*108494*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplsh_s030_050_kra:40-520]]
No… I imagine
*108495*
[[S:::1670-2750]]
not.
*108496*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplsh_s035_010_son:70-4500]]
This clan really didn’t want anyone coming in. How’re we supposed to get through?
*108497*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplsh_s035_020_kra:0-1750]]
There must be a way to lift the gate.
*108498*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplsh_s035_030_son:50-1420]]
Maybe with the big water wheel…
*108499*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplsh_s035_040_kra:0-1000]]
My thought as well.
*108500*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplsh_s040_010_kra:110-1000]]
When are you angry?
*108501*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplsh_s040_020_son:31-438]]
What?
*108502*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplsh_s040_030_kra:170-2170]]
With me. When?
*108503*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplsh_s040_040_son:30-470]]
Oh.
*108504*
[[S:::1280-1930]]
I guess,
*108505*
[[S:::2910-5230]]
sometimes, when you don’t think I can do something…
*108506*
[[S:::5850-6250]]
but I can.
*108507*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplsh_s040_050_kra:240-2310]]
It is not always easy to know one’s…
*108508*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplsh_s040_060_son:60-1750]]
It’s okay. I get it. I’m little.
*108509*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplsh_s040_070_son:22-1445]]
Where’s that whetstone, I wonder?
*108510*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplsh_s065_010_son:46-1055]]
What happened over there?
*108511*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplsh_s070_010_son:0-1870]]
I wonder why they left this whetstone behind.
*108512*
[[S:::2750-3730]]
If Sindri wants it,
*108513*
[[S:::4330-5360]]
it must be really useful.
*108514*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_xplsh_s070_020_mmr:40-2410]]
Well lad, reavers have very specific priorities.
*108515*
[[S:::2790-4830]]
If it’s not shiny, and you can’t eat or drink it,
*108516*
[[S:::5330-6940]]
might as well use it as a blunt object.
*108517*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_xplsh_s075_010_mmr:30-2150]]
Lads, I think there’s a way inside this vessel.
*108518*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplsh_s080_010_son:50-720]]
This says:
*108519*
[[S:::1290-2200]]
“False Leader.”
*108520*
[[S:::3220-4750]]
I’ve seen it written all over this place…
*108521*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplsh_s085_010_son:65-1019]]
There’s a scroll here.
*108522*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplsh_s085_020_son:53-3671]]
It belonged to the son! Wow, this goes on and on…
*108523*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplsh_s085_020_son_a:50-1170]]
It belonged to the son!
*108524*
[[S:::1940-2360]]
Wow,
*108525*
[[S:::2990-3750]]
this goes on and on…
*108526*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplsh_s085_030_son:600-4240]]
Father forgive me… filled with remorse… regret my actions…
*108527*
[[S:::5360-5750]]
hmm.
*108528*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplsh_s085_030_son_a:150-2610]]
Father forgive me… filled with remorse…
*108529*
[[S:::3090-4340]]
regret my actions…
*108530*
[[S:::5480-6090]]
hmm.
*108531*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplsh_s085_040_kra:30-4500]]
Had he thought before taking action… There would be no need for regret, yes?
*108532*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplsh_s085_050_son:60-320]]
Yea.
*108533*
[[S:::1150-2600]]
Maybe we should bring this to his father,
*108534*
[[S:::3040-3750]]
back at the Storeroom?
*108535*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplsh_s085_060_kra:53-787]]
Hrmph.
*108536*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplsh_s090_005_sin:100-1450]]
How’d it go at the Stronghold?
*108537*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplsh_s090_006_sin:78-2556]]
You didn’t happen to find the whetstone, perchance?
*108538*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplsh_s090_010_kra:70-1250]]
We found your whetstone.
*108539*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplsh_s090_020_sin:0-460]]
Oh,
*108540*
[[S:::970-1750]]
wonderful!
*108541*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplsh_s090_030_sin:35-1732]]
This staining is unusual…
*108542*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplsh_s090_040_son:30-2500]]
The reavers used it to smash another reaver’s face in!
*108543*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplsh_s090_050_sin:0-400]]
Oh.
*108544*
[[S:::1320-2000]]
Wonderful.
*108545*
[[S:::2550-2950]]
Here,
*108546*
[[S:::3550-4250]]
for your trouble.
*108547*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplsh_s095_010_sin:84-6273]]
I can’t wait to test out the new whetstone. It may not look like much… but it’s practically humming
*108548*
[[S:::6273-6953]]
with magic.
*108549*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplsh_s095_020_sin:50-2780]]
I’ve needed a new one after my brother borrowed the last one.
*108550*
[[S:::3140-3850]]
I saw him
*108551*
[[S:::4360-5170]]
spit on it.
*108552*
[[S:::5850-7860]]
“To lube it up!” he said.
*108553*
[[S:::8520-9700]]
I didn’t ask for it back.
*108554*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s005_010_son:0-700]]
Veiðadauðr.
*108555*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s005_020_son:31-2383]]
It means, “Hunting Death.”
*108556*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s005_030_son:0-300]]
Great.
*108557*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s005_040_son:70-950]]
Veithurgard:
*108558*
[[S:::1750-3840]]
Southern Outpost of the Dwarven King.
*108559*
[[S:::5090-6000]]
Dwarven… King?
*108560*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s005_050_son:40-1410]]
Have you ever heard of a Dwarven King?
*108561*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s005_060_kra:70-300]]
No.
*108562*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_xplvf_s005_070_mmr:80-4350]]
I’d heard rumours of a powerful Dwarf ruling over some poor sods not far from here.
*108563*
[[S:::4790-5650]]
Not that you asked me.
*108564*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s010_010_son:70-630]]
Hey Brok,
*108565*
[[S:::1320-2500]]
you ever hear of a Dwarf King?
*108566*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplvf_s010_020_brk:120-2620]]
I s’pose you’re talking ’bout Motsògnir?
*108567*
[[S:::3190-6460]]
Sumbitch ruled over the humans once lived in this area.
*108568*
[[S:::6870-9400]]
Built hisself a castle just north o’ here.
*108569*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s010_030_son:55-2820]]
A Dwarven castle? What’s it like?
*108570*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplvf_s010_040_brk:0-2860]]
You got yourself a pair a eyes and legs, aintcha?
*108571*
[[S:::3380-6080]]
Might wanna stock up ’fore you head that way, though…
*108572*
[[S:::6430-11150]]
Ol’ Motsògnir’s known fer collecting all manner of Killering Creatures…
*108573*
[[S:::11590-13500]]
Not sure who’s lookin’ after ’em now.
*108574*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s015_010_son:0-1200]]
What happened to these people?
*108575*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s015_020_kra:30-1000]]
Follow the clues.
*108576*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s015_030_son:40-520]]
Okay,
*108577*
[[S:::1010-1540]]
well,
*108578*
[[S:::2130-3060]]
scorch marks.
*108579*
[[S:::3970-5180]]
They’re all grouped together…
*108580*
[[S:::5950-8730]]
so maybe they were hiding from some kind of fire-breather?
*108581*
[[S:::10270-11500]]
But they died anyways.
*108582*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s015_030_son_a:40-360]]
Okay,
*108583*
[[S:::930-2820]]
well, scorch marks.
*108584*
[[S:::3460-4660]]
They’re all grouped together…
*108585*
[[S:::5350-8440]]
so maybe they were hiding from some kind of fire-breather?
*108586*
[[S:::9460-10500]]
But they died anyways.
*108587*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s020_010_son:40-1160]]
“Curse the Dwarf King,
*108588*
[[S:::2020-3000]]
Bane of Mankind”
*108589*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s020_020_son:26-4651]]
Sounds like he wasn’t a very good king. I wonder why they hated him so much.
*108590*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s020_020_son_a:26-1845]]
Sounds like he wasn’t a very good king.
*108591*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s020_030_kra:60-1320]]
They are dead now.
*108592*
[[S:::2100-2750]]
Does it matter?
*108593*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s020_040_son:50-2127]]
No… I’m just curious.
*108594*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s020_050_kra:50-3250]]
Curiosity is dangerous, boy. Stay focused.
*108595*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s025_010_son:0-624]]
Wow…
*108596*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s025_020_son:130-2250]]
How do you even begin to build statues this big?
*108597*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s025_030_kra:50-2720]]
Dwarves are resourceful creatures. Annoying,
*108598*
[[S:::3220-4000]]
but resourceful.
*108599*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s025_040_son:35-2217]]
I guess they must have been pretty important Dwarves.
*108600*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s030_010_son:70-832]]
Do you hear that?
*108601*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s030_020_son:76-1145]]
That sounds like a dragon!
*108602*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s035_010_son:36-3089]]
Is that a dragon?! I’ve never seen one so close!
*108603*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s035_020_son:72-2270]]
It is a dragon! Is this one chained up too?
*108604*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s040_010_son:60-1250]]
Watch out for the Dragon breath!
*108605*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s040_020_kra:80-1250]]
I am aware of it, boy!
*108606*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s040_030_son:60-1120]]
A chained dragon.
*108607*
[[S:::2170-3540]]
Mother used to tell me stories…
*108608*
[[S:::4490-5170]]
Can we help him?
*108609*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s040_040_kra:50-1500]]
This Dragon is dangerous.
*108610*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s040_050_son:630-1340]]
I guess so…
*108611*
[[S:::2070-3000]]
But it sounds so sad.
*108612*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_xplvf_s040_060_mmr:0-3250]]
Not sure where you get “sad” from all the roaring and fire-breathing, lad.
*108613*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s040_070_son:40-1120]]
Another chained dragon.
*108614*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s040_080_kra:70-1590]]
With more Dragon Tears.
*108615*
[[S:::2090-3500]]
Eyes open for the shrines.
*108616*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s040_090_son:50-680]]
Yes, sir!
*108617*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s045_010_son:40-970]]
The dragon shrine…
*108618*
[[S:::1680-4190]]
Mother had a story about three chained dragons in Midgard.
*108619*
[[S:::4790-5900]]
This shrine must be related.
*108620*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s045_020_kra:110-2250]]
There were three runes on the pedestal…
*108621*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s045_030_son:60-1770]]
We’ve gotta find the other two and free him!
*108622*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s045_030_son_a:44-1637]]
We’ve gotta find the other two and free him!
*108623*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s045_040_kra:160-1500]]
It does not concern us.
*108624*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s045_050_son:62-4975]]
I know, but… It’s what Mother would have wanted. And it just seems right.
*108625*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s045_060_kra:0-1450]]
Guard your emotions, boy.
*108626*
[[S:::1800-4440]]
Your enemies will not hesitate to use them against you.
*108627*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s045_070_son:40-500]]
Yes, sir.
*108628*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s045_080_son:59-2011]]
That’s one down! Two more to go.
*108629*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s050_010_son:0-2394]]
I thought you said it’d be dangerous to destroy the other ones…
*108630*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s050_020_kra:938-2678]]
If it was your Mother’s wish…
*108631*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s050_030_son:34-602]]
Yea!
*108632*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s050_040_kra:60-3940]]
You are too eager, boy. It may attack us, and we will be forced to kill it.
*108633*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s050_050_son:60-410]]
Oh…
*108634*
[[S:::910-1420]]
Good point.
*108635*
[[S:::2245-2750]]
I’ll be ready.
*108636*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s050_060_kra:58-1985]]
Hmph. We will see.
*108637*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s050_070_son:0-1000]]
Just one shrine left.
*108638*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s055_010_son:40-890]]
That’s the last one.
*108639*
[[S:::1360-3750]]
I guess now we find out if dragons can be grateful or not.
*108640*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s055_020_son:69-2910]]
That’s all of them! Time to go collect some tears.
*108641*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s060_010_son:50-1000]]
Please don’t eat us,
*108642*
[[S:::1660-2720]]
please don’t eat us…
*108643*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s060_020_kra:110-1940]]
Boy! Prepare yourself!
*108644*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s060_030_son:4-381]]
Huh…
*108645*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s060_040_son:30-976]]
You’re welcome!
*108646*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s060_050_son:17-784]]
What is that?
*108647*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s060_060_kra:70-1050]]
I do not know…
*108648*
[[S:::1680-3430]]
I have never seen such material.
*108649*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s060_070_son:60-1390]]
I bet Brok or Sindri would know!
*108650*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s060_080_son:50-1940]]
You’re friendly too, right?
*108651*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s060_090_kra:68-847]]
Boy…
*108652*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s060_100_son:70-1620]]
They sure are beautiful creatures,
*108653*
[[S:::2130-2740]]
don’t you think?
*108654*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s060_110_kra:18-414]]
Hmph.
*108655*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s065_010_son:0-1270]]
Not very many graves here…
*108656*
[[S:::2040-3450]]
This must’ve been a small settlement.
*108657*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s065_020_son:0-640]]
Draugr.
*108658*
[[S:::1120-2470]]
Dragon. Troll.
*108659*
[[S:::3440-3840]]
Hmm…
*108660*
[[S:::4420-5400]]
some kind of list?
*108661*
[[S:::5900-6500]]
Of monsters?
*108662*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s065_030_kra:100-1500]]
It is known as a “Bestiary.”
*108663*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s065_040_son:60-1570]]
Best – ee – airy.
*108664*
[[S:::2710-3150]]
Neat.
*108665*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s070_010_son:33-3703]]
Oh… I guess this was actually a pretty big settlement.
*108666*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s070_020_kra:150-1000]]
No longer.
*108667*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s070_030_son:70-1653]]
Hey, look at this.
*108668*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s070_040_son:60-2270]]
It says, “Fallen Hunters.
*108669*
[[S:::2890-4000]]
Motsògnir’s Folly.”
*108670*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s070_050_kra:60-2290]]
All these dead. From hunting.
*108671*
[[S:::2970-3750]]
Folly indeed.
*108672*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s075_010_son:0-2290]]
Looks like the runes on the right side fell off…
*108673*
[[S:::3130-4420]]
They must be around here, somewhere.
*108674*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s075_020_son:45-599]]
There’s one!
*108675*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s075_030_son:62-2560]]
Aaand the other. This should be easy to solve now.
*108676*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s075_040_kra:150-1000]]
What do they say, boy?
*108677*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s075_050_son:0-520]]
Trùa.
*108678*
[[S:::1120-2490]]
It means… “to believe,”
*108679*
[[S:::2880-3940]]
or, “to have faith in.”
*108680*
[[S:::4890-6440]]
So they still had faith in their king…
*108681*
[[S:::7000-8750]]
even after he got so many of them killed?
*108682*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s075_060_kra:50-1200]]
It is a command…
*108683*
[[S:::1700-3750]]
to have faith despite his failures.
*108684*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s080_010_son:4-2165]]
Wow, look at this place.
*108685*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s080_020_kra:50-500]]
A ruin.
*108686*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s080_030_son:0-610]]
Well, yea.
*108687*
[[S:::1590-2690]]
But if a dwarf built it,
*108688*
[[S:::3300-4750]]
it must have been impressive back when he ruled.
*108689*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s085_010_son:8-708]]
Hmm…
*108690*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s085_020_son:60-3040]]
The Dwarf King made his subjects hunt dragons and other monsters for him…
*108691*
[[S:::4000-4880]]
Some king, huh?
*108692*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s085_030_son:0-970]]
Uh, Father?
*108693*
[[S:::1920-3000]]
You may want to see this.
*108694*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s085_040_son:13-1938]]
Looks like that lever over there will free him.
*108695*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s085_050_kra:130-750]]
He will attack.
*108696*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s085_060_son:100-670]]
I know, but…
*108697*
[[S:::1530-3380]]
It feels wrong to keep something caged like this.
*108698*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s085_070_kra:54-2564]]
Hmph. Your emotions again, boy?
*108699*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s085_080_son:41-2510]]
You can’t hear their thoughts. I can.
*108700*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s085_090_kra:120-1500]]
Ignore them. And…
*108701*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s085_100_kra:1010-1750]]
Ready yourself.
*108702*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s085_110_son:2-448]]
OKAY!
*108703*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s085_120_son:9-1002]]
Whew…
*108704*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s085_130_kra:100-1500]]
What is the beast thinking now?
*108705*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s085_140_son:0-1180]]
Well, nothing.
*108706*
[[S:::1900-3290]]
But he was grateful to die in battle,
*108707*
[[S:::3950-5000]]
instead of rotting in a cage.
*108708*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s085_150_kra:0-1370]]
Your skill is improving.
*108709*
[[S:::2110-3250]]
You fought well, Atreus.
*108710*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s085_160_son:17-858]]
Thank you, father.
*108711*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s090_010_son:40-2500]]
Ah, fresh air feels good.
*108712*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s090_020_son:0-1500]]
Oh, right, the dragon…
*108713*
[[S:::2520-3710]]
Guess we should take care of that…
*108714*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s095_010_son:0-520]]
So…
*108715*
[[S:::1350-3000]]
What happened to all the people who lived here?
*108716*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s095_020_kra:9-1962]]
Follow the clues, boy.
*108717*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s095_030_son:0-1781]]
Right, right, follow the clues.
*108718*
[[S:::2540-5188]]
Okay. So. There was an Evil Dwarf King.
*108719*
[[S:::5540-7689]]
And he made all these people hunt monsters.
*108720*
[[S:::8140-10541]]
The people put them in cages… and then…
*108721*
[[S:::11430-12000]]
And then I don’t know.
*108722*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s095_040_kra:48-2878]]
Hmm… We are missing a clue.
*108723*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s095_050_son:40-1239]]
Back inside the castle?
*108724*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s095_060_kra:40-460]]
No.
*108725*
[[S:::1210-3070]]
There is nothing more for us inside.
*108726*
[[S:::3620-5990]]
But stay alert for chained dragons, boy.
*108727*
[[S:::6410-8500]]
Perhaps you’ll uncover more about this Dwarf King.
*108728*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s095_070_son:17-1337]]
So you’re interested now?
*108729*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplvf_s095_080_kra:170-690]]
No.
*108730*
[[S:::1110-2750]]
But the dragon tears are valuable.
*108731*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplvf_s095_090_son:30-2321]]
Huh. Of COURSE that’s why.
*108732*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s005_010_son:80-640]]
Hey, look,
*108733*
[[S:::1110-1650]]
a torch.
*108734*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s005_020_kra:40-1490]]
A torch is built with wood.
*108735*
[[S:::2030-2740]]
That is a brazier.
*108736*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s005_030_son:30-1943]]
A “brazier.”
*108737*
[[S:::2810-3210]]
Hmm.
*108738*
[[S:::4040-5300]]
Looks like there’s something written on it.
*108739*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s005_040_son:30-710]]
Want me to read it?
*108740*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s005_050_son_f:55-888]]
“Kveikja”
*108741*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s005_050_son_e:61-1040]]
“Kveikja”
*108742*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s005_050_son_g:67-998]]
“Kveikja”
*108743*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s005_050_son_i:76-846]]
“Kveikja”
*108744*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s005_050_son_h:54-915]]
“Kveikja”
*108745*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s005_050_son_a:42-1106]]
“Kveikja”
*108746*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s005_050_son_b:53-1121]]
“Kveikja”
*108747*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s005_050_son_d:40-1011]]
“Kveikja”
*108748*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s005_050_son_c:74-964]]
“Kveikja”
*108749*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 1:vo_lvl_xplln_s010_010_lksp1:70-1250]]
Well fought, you two!
*108750*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s010_020_son:40-750]]
What is that?
*108751*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s010_030_kra:27-872]]
A Spirit.
*108752*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s010_040_son:63-1109]]
It’s talking to us!
*108753*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 1:vo_lvl_xplln_s010_050_lksp1:40-1540]]
And it hears you as well!
*108754*
[[S:::2110-3250]]
Don’t be shy, now.
*108755*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s010_060_son:25-1381]]
Hey, it’s another spirit.
*108756*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 1:vo_lvl_xplln_s015_010_lksp1:60-1920]]
Come, now. I don’t bite!
*108757*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 1:vo_lvl_xplln_s015_020_lksp1:90-2120]]
Aren’t you even a little intrigued?
*108758*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s020_010_son:40-440]]
You’re…
*108759*
[[S:::800-1250]]
dead?
*108760*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 1:vo_lvl_xplln_s020_020_lksp1:1100-2490]]
You’re very perceptive!
*108761*
[[S:::2920-3840]]
And reckless.
*108762*
[[S:::4520-10980]]
Take caution when lighting these Braziers. Seiðr and Hel-Walkers will swarm to the flames like moths.
*108763*
[[S:::11850-15250]]
I assume we have you to thank for freeing us from a watery grave.
*108764*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s020_030_son:2-454]]
Us?
*108765*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 1:vo_lvl_xplln_s020_060_lksp1:320-1350]]
Other spirits.
*108766*
[[S:::1850-3600]]
The Lake of Nine is full of ’em!
*108767*
[[S:::4430-7000]]
Most are able to move on from this realm,
*108768*
[[S:::7540-11210]]
but we “lucky” few are stuck here in Midgard
*108769*
[[S:::11650-13500]]
until our affairs are in order.
*108770*
[[S:::14420-16000]]
Perhaps you can help them as well?
*108771*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s020_070_kra:0-2250]]
We have no desire to help you, Spirit.
*108772*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 1:vo_lvl_xplln_s020_080_lksp1:110-1920]]
Ah, but you already have!
*108773*
[[S:::3080-5780]]
I only wished to see the sky again.
*108774*
[[S:::6960-7560]]
Farewell.
*108775*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s020_090_son:63-693]]
Hello there!
*108776*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 1:vo_lvl_xplln_s020_100_lksp1:160-1420]]
Hello, young one!
*108777*
[[S:::2290-9050]]
Take caution when lighting these Braziers. Seiðr and Hel-Walkers will swarm to the flames like moths.
*108778*
[[S:::10160-13500]]
I assume we have you to thank for freeing us from a watery grave.
*108779*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s020_101_son:5-417]]
Us?
*108780*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 1:vo_lvl_xplln_s020_102_lksp1:0-1060]]
Other spirits.
*108781*
[[S:::1530-3280]]
The Lake of Nine is full of ’em!
*108782*
[[S:::4120-6690]]
Most are able to move on from this realm,
*108783*
[[S:::7220-10890]]
but we “lucky” few are stuck here in Midgard
*108784*
[[S:::11340-13190]]
until our affairs are in order.
*108785*
[[S:::14100-15750]]
Perhaps you can help them as well?
*108786*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s020_103_kra:0-2250]]
We have no desire to help you, Spirit.
*108787*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 1:vo_lvl_xplln_s020_104_lksp1:0-1790]]
Ah, but you already have!
*108788*
[[S:::2960-5610]]
I only wished to see the sky again.
*108789*
[[S:::6830-7500]]
Farewell.
*108790*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s020_110_son:80-1706]]
Whoah. He disappeared!
*108791*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s020_120_kra:20-360]]
Come.
*108792*
[[S:::1000-2250]]
Let us not be distracted.
*108793*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s025_010_son:80-610]]
So,
*108794*
[[S:::1250-3210]]
I guess we should keep an eye out for other Spirits.
*108795*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s025_020_kra:40-2000]]
What did I say about distractions?
*108796*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s025_030_son:47-1330]]
But it sounds like they needed help.
*108797*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s025_040_kra:40-1740]]
They are Spirits, boy.
*108798*
[[S:::2090-5750]]
Dead things. They have no needs. Only wants.
*108799*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s025_050_son:80-1580]]
It feels wrong to ignore them.
*108800*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s025_060_kra:20-1250]]
You will get over these feelings.
*108801*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s025_070_son:0-1250]]
Mom would have wanted to help them…
*108802*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s025_080_kra:48-1137]]
What was that, boy?
*108803*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s025_090_son:80-651]]
Nothing!
*108804*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s025_100_kra:29-1414]]
I thought as much.
*108805*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s025_110_kra:0-1750]]
Have you learned nothing from Alfheim?
*108806*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s025_120_son:70-550]]
I…
*108807*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s025_120_son_a:40-300]]
I…
*108808*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s025_130_kra:0-1470]]
We have one goal:
*108809*
[[S:::1910-4920]]
To reach the peak of the mountain and spread your mother’s ashes.
*108810*
[[S:::5340-8750]]
Anything that does not serve that goal is a distraction.
*108811*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s025_140_kra:40-2560]]
We have one goal: To reach Jötunheim.
*108812*
[[S:::3140-6250]]
Anything that does not serve that goal is a distraction.
*108813*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s025_150_kra:0-2640]]
Our only concern is to go home, Atreus.
*108814*
[[S:::3150-6000]]
Anything that does not serve that goal is a distraction.
*108815*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s030_010_son:50-1602]]
Hey, it’s another brazier.
*108816*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s030_020_kra:70-1540]]
I suppose you wish to light it.
*108817*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s030_030_son:70-500]]
Can I?
*108818*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s030_040_son:28-919]]
“Kveikja”
*108819*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 2:vo_lvl_xplln_s035_010_lksp2:8-3292]]
I don’t believe it. Are you both… alive?
*108820*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s035_020_son:90-920]]
Another Spirit!
*108821*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s035_030_kra:0-1750]]
Yes. Another Spirit.
*108822*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 2:vo_lvl_xplln_s040_010_lksp2:0-1090]]
Are you really there?
*108823*
[[S:::1920-3100]]
Or did I just imagine that?
*108824*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 2:vo_lvl_xplln_s040_020_lksp2:10-4789]]
Please… it’s been so many winters since I had someone to talk to…
*108825*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s045_010_son:100-400]]
Hello!
*108826*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 2:vo_lvl_xplln_s045_020_lksp2:9-5635]]
I can’t remember the last time I saw something walk these islands that wasn’t dead or corrupted.
*108827*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s045_030_son:40-750]]
What do you mean?
*108828*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 2:vo_lvl_xplln_s045_040_lksp2:0-1180]]
The Desolation, child.
*108829*
[[S:::1910-2900]]
It plagues this land,
*108830*
[[S:::3270-5250]]
growing more severe with each passing winter.
*108831*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s045_050_kra:0-1300]]
Do you know its cause?
*108832*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 2:vo_lvl_xplln_s045_060_lksp2:120-1010]]
Not for certain, but
*108833*
[[S:::1720-3950]]
I suspect the appearance of the World Serpent…
*108834*
[[S:::4450-6340]]
along with the Great Flood that followed.
*108835*
[[S:::7010-8870]]
Many were drowned, myself among them.
*108836*
[[S:::9720-11250]]
The dead began to walk not long after.
*108837*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s045_070_son:60-1200]]
Do you need anything from us?
*108838*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s045_080_kra:0-602]]
Boy!
*108839*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 2:vo_lvl_xplln_s045_090_lksp2:120-1850]]
I only wished to speak to someone again—
*108840*
[[S:::2710-4150]]
a wish you have just granted.
*108841*
[[S:::5010-5600]]
Thank you.
*108842*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s045_100_son:56-718]]
That was easy!
*108843*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s045_100_son_a:57-782]]
That was easy!
*108844*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s050_010_kra:50-2500]]
Boy. What did I tell you about offering help?
*108845*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s050_020_son:2220-2690]]
“Don’t.”
*108846*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s050_020_son_a:46-1697]]
“Don’t.”
*108847*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s050_030_kra:40-500]]
Correct.
*108848*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s050_040_son:67-1146]]
But can’t we just—
*108849*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s050_050_kra:190-1590]]
This is not a debate.
*108850*
[[S:::2100-3420]]
You must learn focus.
*108851*
[[S:::3920-5910]]
Our journey need be your only concern.
*108852*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s050_060_son:54-3752]]
But what if they can help us? That one seemed to know a little about the lake.
*108853*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s050_070_kra:34-2452]]
And how does that help us with our goal?
*108854*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s050_080_son:80-1394]]
We won’t know unless we ask!
*108855*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s055_010_son:39-511]]
Well?
*108856*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s055_020_kra:60-750]]
Well what?
*108857*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s055_030_son:50-750]]
The brazier?
*108858*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s055_040_kra:27-1067]]
If you must.
*108859*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s055_050_son:11-929]]
“Kveikja”
*108860*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 3:vo_lvl_xplln_s060_010_lksp3:680-2040]]
Ha! Well done, boys!
*108861*
[[S:::2630-4750]]
Never thought I’d see a scrap like that again.
*108862*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 3:vo_lvl_xplln_s065_010_lksp3:170-1750]]
C’mere and let me thank you proper.
*108863*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 3:vo_lvl_xplln_s065_020_lksp3:0-3688]]
Certainly… Come on… you’re not afraid of a harmless spirit, are ya?
*108864*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s070_010_kra:20-980]]
What do you want?
*108865*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 3:vo_lvl_xplln_s070_020_lksp3:0-860]]
To thank you!
*108866*
[[S:::1240-4040]]
These dead Reavers drowned me many winters ago,
*108867*
[[S:::4530-6650]]
and I’ve been itching to see ’em get theirs.
*108868*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s070_030_son:40-1677]]
So you died after all the flooding?
*108869*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 3:vo_lvl_xplln_s070_040_lksp3:90-800]]
Indeed.
*108870*
[[S:::1320-4000]]
I came to the Lake of Nine to pillage Týr’s Temple.
*108871*
[[S:::4560-7410]]
But I underestimated the severity of the Desolation.
*108872*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s070_050_kra:50-1300]]
Have you seen other men?
*108873*
[[S:::2020-2602]]
Living?
*108874*
[[S:::3200-4944]]
A bearded one with tattoos?
*108875*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 3:vo_lvl_xplln_s070_060_lksp3:0-2080]]
Only the one standing in front of me!
*108876*
[[S:::2840-5250]]
Thank you both for avenging my death.
*108877*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s070_070_kra:21-1040]]
Useless.
*108878*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s070_080_son:70-471]]
Well,
*108879*
[[S:::1310-3423]]
we can’t expect them ALL to know something useful.
*108880*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s075_010_son:49-2085]]
Maybe the next one will have more information.
*108881*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s075_010_son_a:50-1860]]
Maybe the next one will have more information.
*108882*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s075_020_kra:250-2180]]
Keep your expectations low, boy.
*108883*
[[S:::2750-4250]]
Spirits are rarely useful.
*108884*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s075_030_son:0-1170]]
How do they even exist?
*108885*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s075_040_kra:50-4000]]
When you sever a man from his life, it is not always a clean cut.
*108886*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s075_050_son:47-1496]]
So you’ve met other spirits?
*108887*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s075_060_kra:0-1761]]
Yes. Many.
*108888*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s075_070_son:90-836]]
What were they like?
*108889*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s075_080_kra:26-1144]]
Annoying.
*108890*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s080_010_son:80-1350]]
I think this is the last one.
*108891*
[[S:::2170-3430]]
Might as well, right?
*108892*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s080_020_kra:34-925]]
Fine.
*108893*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s080_030_son:15-816]]
“Kveikja”
*108894*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 4:vo_lvl_xplln_s085_010_lksp4:40-1961]]
You! I must speak with you!
*108895*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s085_020_kra:80-2310]]
Another Spirit who wants something from us.
*108896*
[[S:::2900-4000]]
How unexpected.
*108897*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 4:vo_lvl_xplln_s090_010_lksp4:0-1500]]
Please! I need your help!
*108898*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 4:vo_lvl_xplln_s090_020_lksp4:0-767]]
Please!
*108899*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s095_010_son:0-500]]
What’s wrong?
*108900*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 4:vo_lvl_xplln_s095_020_lksp4:0-3910]]
I came to this lake with a group of tradesmen, seeking refuge from the Desolation.
*108901*
[[S:::4630-7250]]
But how could we know it was even worse at the Lake of Nine!?
*108902*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s095_030_kra:50-2000]]
We cannot undo your mistakes, Spirit.
*108903*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 4:vo_lvl_xplln_s095_040_lksp4:12-983]]
I know that.
*108904*
[[S:::1408-3204]]
But I fear for my captain and crew.
*108905*
[[S:::3853-5639]]
I believe they are still under the water.
*108906*
[[S:::6031-7054]]
Will you find them for me?
*108907*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s095_070_son:190-2370]]
Is there anything you can offer us in return?
*108908*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 4:vo_lvl_xplln_s095_080_lksp4:0-500]]
I…
*108909*
[[S:::995-2500]]
I have little to offer….
*108910*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s095_081_son:170-660]]
Oh…
*108911*
[[S:::1300-2664]]
Well, I’m not sure…
*108912*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 4:vo_lvl_xplln_s095_090_lksp4:0-518]]
Wait!
*108913*
[[S:::860-3040]]
I died wearing a valuable family heirloom.
*108914*
[[S:::3450-5947]]
It’s yours, if you promise to find my crew.
*108915*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s095_100_son:90-479]]
Deal!
*108916*
[[S:LAKE SPIRIT 4:vo_lvl_xplln_s095_110_lksp4:0-750]]
Thank you.
*108917*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s095_120_kra:30-940]]
You are learning.
*108918*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s100_010_son:80-2600]]
It sounds like the Desolation killed or corrupted everything.
*108919*
[[S:::3500-5250]]
Are we the only living people left?
*108920*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s100_020_kra:60-1750]]
We have encountered others in our journey.
*108921*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s100_030_son:60-810]]
I guess so…
*108922*
[[S:::1590-2250]]
but not many.
*108923*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s100_040_kra:0-1500]]
There are other lands than these, boy.
*108924*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s100_050_son:30-2331]]
Why didn’t you or Mom ever tell me about the Desolation?
*108925*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s100_060_kra:25-5733]]
I won’t speak for your mother… But it was never my concern. Nor should it be yours.
*108926*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s100_070_son:66-2509]]
Doesn’t it concern us if everything around us is dying?
*108927*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s100_080_kra:30-2000]]
Our only concern is reaching the peak.
*108928*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s100_081_kra:0-2250]]
Our only concern is reaching Jötunheim.
*108929*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s100_082_kra:0-1750]]
Our only concern is going home.
*108930*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s100_090_son:0-330]]
Really?
*108931*
[[S:::1530-3150]]
Then why are we exploring all these islands?
*108932*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplln_s100_100_kra:50-2820]]
The resources we find improve our equipment.
*108933*
[[S:::3180-7750]]
If we stray from the path, it is only to prepare ourselves for the journey ahead.
*108934*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s100_110_son:120-2100]]
I can live with that if it means we keep exploring.
*108935*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplln_s100_120_son:0-970]]
And helping others.
*108936*
[[S::vo_lvl_xplhttk_s940_010_kra_stem:4040-5750]]
There is a passage behind this throne.
*108937*
[[S::vo_lvl_xplhttk_s940_010_son_stem:7010-8252]]
A secret passage!
*108938*
[[S:::35115-36187]]
Motsògnir…
*108939*
[[S::vo_lvl_xplhttk_s940_010_mmr_stem:8494-11688]]
Well, it wouldn’t be a proper throne room without a secret passage.
*108940*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s005_010_brk:0-5260]]
My brother n’ me got a new project. Come see us at the Temple if it so please you.
*108941*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s005_020_brk:0-3450]]
We’ve got a new recipe for ya at the Temple, if’n yer interested.
*108942*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s005_030_brk:150-2450]]
Come see me and my brother at the Temple sometime.
*108943*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s010_010_sin:0-2750]]
Brok and I are working on something special for you at the Temple.
*108944*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s010_020_sin:50-3750]]
Brok and I have been working on a new project at the Temple. Come visit soon!
*108945*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s010_030_sin:70-2000]]
Come visit Brok and I at the Temple sometime!
*108946*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s015_010_brk:0-2150]]
My brother n’ me got a new project—
*108947*
[[S:::2500-4500]]
now that we’re on speaking terms.
*108948*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s020_010_brk:31-3902]]
This’ll be our best work yet. Just need a little help from you lot.
*108949*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s020_020_brk:0-3750]]
We’re fixin’ up something REAL nice for ya. Give us hand whynot?
*108950*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s025_010_kra:30-750]]
What do you want?
*108951*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s025_020_sin:50-2350]]
With the whetstone and hammer you’ve retrieved for us,
*108952*
[[S:::2890-5160]]
Brok and I can construct the Dvegræðikr;
*108953*
[[S:::5533-7100]]
Dwarven armour of legend!
*108954*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s025_030_brk:0-4000]]
We just needs three more mythical ingredients ’fore we set to hammerin’.
*108955*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s025_040_son:0-500]]
Which are…?
*108956*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s025_040_son_a:0-500]]
Which are…?
*108957*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s025_050_brk:0-5750]]
Dunno! Armour's pure legend, and the details is fuzzier than a Wulver’s butthole.
*108958*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s025_060_kra:250-2750]]
You expect us to find parts from a legend.
*108959*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s025_070_brk:40-4540]]
Ol’ Motsògnir, The Dwarf King found two of ’em! Everyone knows that.
*108960*
[[S:::4540-6500]]
But when he went looking for the third…
*108961*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s025_080_sin:0-1620]]
Poof! He vanished.
*108962*
[[S:::2430-5080]]
Maybe you’ll find some clues at his stronghold in Konùnsgard?
*108963*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s025_090_brk:110-4120]]
And lookee here! A Konùnsgard entry stone.
*108964*
[[S:::4550-6050]]
It’s got yer name on it,
*108965*
[[S:::6410-8000]]
how fuckin’ strange.
*108966*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s030_010_sin:50-3770]]
You had that Entry Stone this whole time?! I’ve been looking everywhere for it…
*108967*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s030_020_brk:0-4000]]
The Stronghold’s northwest a’here, behind the Svartalfheim realm tower.
*108968*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s030_030_brk:0-3750]]
The Stronghold’s south a’here, behind the Svartalfheim realm tower.
*108969*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s030_040_sin:50-2660]]
Large stone structure, creepy atmosphere…
*108970*
[[S:::3110-4250]]
you’ll know it when you see it.
*108971*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s030_050_sin:50-2250]]
The Huldra Brothers, back in action again!
*108972*
[[S:::2810-4430]]
Oh, I can’t wait to get started.
*108973*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s030_060_brk:14-4062]]
Never think I’d see such a day we was back to buildin’ as a duo.
*108974*
[[S:::4062-7309]]
But it feels right, ’specially for this.
*108975*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s030_070_brk:0-2550]]
…been so used to buildin’ on my own all these years.
*108976*
[[S:::2550-5960]]
Almost forgot how dang useful an extra pair ’a hands is.
*108977*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s030_080_sin:320-4750]]
I forgot how much easier it is to smelt skap slag with someone else gauging the temperature!
*108978*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s035_010_son:100-840]]
Konùnsgard…
*108979*
[[S:::1540-3450]]
That must be that creepy castle we saw earlier
*108980*
[[S:::4020-5230]]
with the chained up Dragon outside.
*108981*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s035_020_kra:90-1000]]
And fierce enemies.
*108982*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s035_030_son:40-3576]]
Yeah… probably wouldn’t hurt to make sure we’re prepared before going back.
*108983*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s035_040_kra:19-2189]]
It is good to see you learning, Atreus.
*108984*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s035_050_son:48-2684]]
I’m glad Brok and Sindri were able to work out their differences.
*108985*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s035_060_kra:29-2304]]
Now they are twice as irritating.
*108986*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s035_070_son:0-400]]
Aw…
*108987*
[[S:::750-2690]]
I think it’s nice to see them trust each other again.
*108988*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s040_010_sin:70-2500]]
Greetings! And welcome to Konùnsgard.
*108989*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s040_020_son:20-1307]]
What is this place?
*108990*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s040_030_sin:90-5240]]
This land was once ruled over by Mótsognir, the infamous Dwarven King.
*108991*
[[S:::5960-7900]]
His Stronghold still stands,
*108992*
[[S:::8300-9720]]
but good luck getting in;
*108993*
[[S:::10250-13710]]
there’s all kinds of nasty beasties between here and there.
*108994*
[[S:::14380-16140]]
That, and the front entrance is locked.
*108995*
[[S:::16660-18540]]
Don’t ask me about the third Entry Stone.
*108996*
[[S:::19220-20235]]
I don’t want to talk about it.
*108997*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s040_040_son:70-1000]]
Oookayyy….
*108998*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s040_050_son:30-1680]]
We could only find two Entry Stones.
*108999*
[[S:::2170-3200]]
Do you know where the third one?
*109000*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s040_050_son_a:45-2966]]
We could only find two Entry Stones.  Do you know where the third—
*109001*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s040_060_sin:50-1250]]
I told you not to ask!
*109002*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s040_070_kra:59-2434]]
(growls) You will tell us where the stone is.
*109003*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s040_080_sin:50-1100]]
I CAN’T, okay?
*109004*
[[S:::1620-2560]]
I LOST it.
*109005*
[[S:::3170-3902]]
Are you happy now?
*109006*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s040_090_kra:30-600]]
No.
*109007*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s040_100_sin:190-1450]]
Check back in with me later.
*109008*
[[S:::1930-2750]]
Maybe it will turn up?
*109009*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s040_110_sin:236-3400]]
Just want to make sure you’re good and prepared before heading in any further.
*109010*
[[S:::3910-8353]]
There’s all manner of nastiness left over from the Mad Dwarf King’s foul practices.
*109011*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s040_120_son:31-1410]]
What kind of practices?
*109012*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s040_130_sin:80-700]]
Oh…
*109013*
[[S:::960-1847]]
various…
*109014*
[[S:::2470-6643]]
sacrificing, dark enchantments,blood magic and so forth…
*109015*
[[S:::6958-9547]]
quite common among the older Dwarves, unfortunately.
*109016*
[[S:::10460-11750]]
Old habits are hard to break.
*109017*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s045_010_sin:18-4444]]
Hopefully you’ll find some clues about the three legendary ingredients inside this Stronghold.
*109018*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s045_020_sin:40-2000]]
Not a very welcoming place, is it?
*109019*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s050_010_son:31-1831]]
That’s an impressive front door.
*109020*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s050_020_kra:30-1460]]
The enemies are strong here.
*109021*
[[S:::1930-2910]]
Keep your guard up.
*109022*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s050_030_son:110-2760]]
This is the same Dwarf King who built the fortress in Veithurgard,
*109023*
[[S:::3170-3490]]
right?
*109024*
[[S:::4360-5280]]
Chained dragons,
*109025*
[[S:::5950-6650]]
caged Trolls…
*109026*
[[S:::7750-8750]]
This dwarf had weird taste.
*109027*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s055_010_son:0-1500]]
Looks like it needs three entry stones.
*109028*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s055_020_son:40-3050]]
Still won’t open? Looks like we need three…
*109029*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s060_010_son:30-390]]
Well,
*109030*
[[S:::920-1950]]
that’s one entry stone.
*109031*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s060_020_son:50-1950]]
This place is even bigger than Veithurgard.
*109032*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s060_030_kra:0-620]]
Yes.
*109033*
[[S:::1100-3000]]
The Dwarf King’s reach appears vast.
*109034*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s060_040_son:40-1140]]
Wonder what happened to him.
*109035*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s060_050_mmr:20-3150]]
’Tis a great mystery, even amongst the Sons of Ivaldi.
*109036*
[[S:::3630-7390]]
Mótsognir’s behaviour before his disappearance grew increasingly erratic.
*109037*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s060_060_son:32-556]]
Why?
*109038*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s060_070_mmr:20-3880]]
The Dvegræðikr. The very armour you find yourselves searching for.
*109039*
[[S:::4430-5760]]
Though he found two,
*109040*
[[S:::6330-9200]]
I’d wager his failure to find the third ingredient drove him to madness.
*109041*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s065_010_son:0-750]]
Stone number two.
*109042*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s065_020_son:50-500]]
Mimir,
*109043*
[[S:::1410-3280]]
why did the Dwarf King want this armour so badly?
*109044*
[[S:::4110-5150]]
What’s so special about it?
*109045*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s065_030_mmr:0-2130]]
There are many legends behind the Dvegræðikr.
*109046*
[[S:::2570-4450]]
A suspicious amount of legends,
*109047*
[[S:::4450-7850]]
which makes confirming anything about this particular armour difficult.
*109048*
[[S:::8330-13440]]
But the one constant among them is the ability of the armour to offer ultimate protection.
*109049*
[[S:::13830-16420]]
A useful attribute for an unpopular King, you see.
*109050*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s065_040_kra:0-2890]]
Yet this plagued land is all that remains of him.
*109051*
[[S:::3660-5750]]
This is why you do not trust legends, boy.
*109052*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s065_050_son:30-490]]
Well
*109053*
[[S:::1330-2250]]
what can you trust?
*109054*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s065_060_kra:0-2870]]
Yourself. Your eyes. Your instincts.
*109055*
[[S:::3580-7670]]
Blind trust in a legend is a gamble. And rarely does it pay off.
*109056*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s065_070_son:50-750]]
If you say so.
*109057*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s070_010_son:47-3028]]
These materials must be pretty special to make a legendary armour.
*109058*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s070_020_kra:20-3250]]
This “legendary” armour better be worth the trouble.
*109059*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s070_030_son:41-3527]]
But if Brok and Sindri are making it together, I’m sure it’s worth the effort.
*109060*
[[S:::4984-6211]]
Don’t you trust them, at least?
*109061*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s070_040_kra:60-3000]]
I trust you, Atreus. I do not trust the legend.
*109062*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s070_050_son:45-567]]
Oh.
*109063*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s075_010_son:66-627]]
We’re In!
*109064*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s075_020_son:130-510]]
Okay,
*109065*
[[S:::1320-1920]]
here we go!
*109066*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s075_030_son:52-2235]]
Huh… it’s kinda run down in here.
*109067*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s075_040_kra:0-1180]]
What did you expect?
*109068*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s075_050_son:0-550]]
I dunno…
*109069*
[[S:::1590-2610]]
Less ruin, I guess?
*109070*
[[S:::3720-5210]]
Maybe the Throne Room’s in better shape.
*109071*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s080_010_son:13-813]]
Do you hear that?
*109072*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s080_020_kra:0-530]]
No.
*109073*
[[S:::1060-1750]]
What do you hear, boy?
*109074*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s080_030_son:80-680]]
Crying…
*109075*
[[S:::1750-2580]]
and screams.
*109076*
[[S:::4450-5500]]
A large crowd of people.
*109077*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s080_040_mmr:0-2080]]
Errr… just old spirits, I suppose.
*109078*
[[S:::2440-5400]]
Leftover victims of the Mad Dwarf’s reign. Still…
*109079*
[[S:::5990-7250]]
that’s rather ominous.
*109080*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s085_010_son:70-930]]
They’re getting louder.
*109081*
[[S:::1850-2750]]
They sound almost like…
*109082*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s085_020_son:104-970]]
Hel-Walkers!
*109083*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s085_030_son:20-910]]
Whoof…
*109084*
[[S:::2190-3500]]
that was a lot of Hel-Walkers.
*109085*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s085_040_son:0-1190]]
Hey, look at this.
*109086*
[[S:::1540-2250]]
A blood trail…
*109087*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s095_010_son:0-1000]]
His last words…
*109088*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s105_010_son:80-1180]]
The things you pulled from him…
*109089*
[[S:::2140-4920]]
those must be the three mythical ingredients Brok was talking about.
*109090*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s105_020_mmr:290-5250]]
I can say with utmost certainty that I’ve never laid eye on a stranger set of objects in my life.
*109091*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s105_030_son:50-2310]]
How are Brok and Sindri supposed to build with…
*109092*
[[S:::3480-4250]]
whatever they are?
*109093*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s105_040_mmr:28-4896]]
Don’t count the Dwarves out, lad. They’re right pricks, but they’re resourceful. They once made an
*109094*
[[S:::4896-8534]]
unbreakable chain out of little more than a cat’s footstep and bird spit!
*109095*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s105_050_son:47-1635]]
That doesn’t even make sense!
*109096*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s105_060_mmr:24-3896]]
Well, that’s the legend. If you wanted sense, you shouldn’t be talking to a severed head!
*109097*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s110_010_son:0-1570]]
Those Hel-Walkers back in the throne room…
*109098*
[[S:::2490-4300]]
They were all the Dwarf King’s people, weren’t they?
*109099*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s110_020_mmr:130-750]]
Aye, lad.
*109100*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s110_030_son:0-1180]]
He killed his own people?
*109101*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s110_040_mmr:60-1110]]
It appears so.
*109102*
[[S:::1770-4270]]
I knew ol’ Mótsognir was a bit cracked, but…
*109103*
[[S:::4850-6000]]
that was rather extreme.
*109104*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s115_010_son:60-2000]]
I wonder what this place looked like in better times.
*109105*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s115_020_mmr:40-2540]]
Konùnsgard was a beautiful land in its heyday.
*109106*
[[S:::3150-5690]]
Before the Dwarf King’s obsession poisoned his mind.
*109107*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s115_030_son:0-1250]]
How could he let that happen?
*109108*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s115_040_kra:0-4480]]
The Dwarf blindly trusted in the legend—and pursued it without thought to the consequences.
*109109*
[[S:::5230-6500]]
This is the result.
*109110*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s115_050_son:30-1060]]
“Trust is a gamble,”
*109111*
[[S:::1430-2110]]
like you said.
*109112*
[[S:::2810-3750]]
And the Dwarf King lost.
*109113*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s120_010_son:60-760]]
We made it.
*109114*
[[S:::1320-1750]]
Finally.
*109115*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s120_020_sin:60-1670]]
You found the legendary materials?!
*109116*
[[S:::2480-3220]]
Incredible!
*109117*
[[S:::3710-5268]]
Oh, this is so exciting!
*109118*
[[S:::5417-7827]]
Meet me back at the temple and we’ll get started right away!
*109119*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s125_010_brk:140-1941]]
You boys look right beamin’.
*109120*
[[S:::2135-4024]]
Well… the squirt does.
*109121*
[[S:::4184-7612]]
Can’t see squat behind that furzelfuzz you call a beard.
*109122*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s130_010_son:25-5803]]
We found the materials! But they’re so weird… How do you build a piece of armour out of
*109123*
[[S:::5803-8204]]
something so… so…
*109124*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s130_020_brk:46-720]]
Nunya?
*109125*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s130_030_son:21-691]]
Nunya?
*109126*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s130_040_brk:30-1470]]
None ’ya fuckin’ business.
*109127*
[[S:::1960-4250]]
Trade secret. We got our ways…
*109128*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s130_050_son:23-726]]
Oh…
*109129*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s135_010_son:44-1059]]
Whoa…
*109130*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s135_020_son:160-4790]]
Look, a dragon! But it’s chained… Is it a pet?
*109131*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s135_030_kra:0-1500]]
Do not get any ideas.
*109132*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s135_040_son:8-1707]]
Look, it’s another dragon.
*109133*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s135_050_kra:10-1117]]
I see it, boy.
*109134*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s135_060_son:40-580]]
Chained…
*109135*
[[S:::1530-3140]]
I hope we can find the Binding Shrines.
*109136*
[[S:::4040-5250]]
This place is huge!
*109137*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s135_070_son:52-1188]]
Look, a dragon!
*109138*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s135_080_kra:10-1117]]
I see it, boy.
*109139*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s140_010_son:70-2290]]
If the Dwarf King captured more than one dragon,
*109140*
[[S:::3150-5250]]
he must’ve needed them to create this legendary armour…
*109141*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s140_020_son:0-2190]]
This must be how the Dwarf King captured Dragon’s Fury—
*109142*
[[S:::3060-4000]]
by chaining up the dragons.
*109143*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s140_030_mmr:60-2730]]
Interesting thought, lad. And it makes sense… Nearly everything about dragons is useful,
*109144*
[[S:::3150-6340]]
and contains power.
*109145*
[[S:::6770-9000]]
Teeth, scales… even excrement.
*109146*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s140_040_son:38-750]]
Excrement?
*109147*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s140_050_mmr:25-1386]]
Ah, uh… shit.
*109148*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s140_060_son:0-1500]]
Dragon shit is powerful?
*109149*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s140_070_mmr:960-2750]]
Aye lad. Potently powerful.
*109150*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s140_080_kra:670-2070]]
The Head is having fun with you.
*109151*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s140_090_son:34-1151]]
Oh. I knew that!
*109152*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s140_100_son:32-2332]]
I can’t believe that chain is the only thing holding him down.
*109153*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s140_110_mmr:0-2640]]
Odds are there’s a bit of magic at play here as well.
*109154*
[[S:::3000-5250]]
This is a Dwarven stronghold, after all.
*109155*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s142_010_son:0-510]]
There he is.
*109156*
[[S:::1330-1740]]
Or…
*109157*
[[S:::2300-2970]]
she is?
*109158*
[[S:::3720-5000]]
Are these boy or girl dragons?
*109159*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s142_020_kra:7-1176]]
I do not know.
*109160*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s142_030_mmr:30-2950]]
There are a few ways to find out… but, they’re rather messy.
*109161*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s142_040_son:34-2547]]
Er.. I guess it doesn’t matter.
*109162*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s145_010_son:60-880]]
One shrine down.
*109163*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s145_020_mmr:30-3750]]
You’d think this dragon would be a bit more supportive, seeing how we’re trying to free it.
*109164*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s150_010_son:53-931]]
One more to go!
*109165*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s150_020_kra:0-1500]]
You enjoy freeing them.
*109166*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s150_030_son:33-2594]]
Well, yeah! Still seems like the right thing to do.
*109167*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s155_010_son:40-830]]
Last one!
*109168*
[[S:::1260-1940]]
Let’s go free him!
*109169*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s155_020_kra:46-663]]
Fine.
*109170*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s160_010_son:30-950]]
Good luck out there!
*109171*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s165_010_son:20-787]]
It says,
*109172*
[[S:::1120-2370]]
“Glory to Mótsognir,
*109173*
[[S:::2870-5012]]
The Dwarf King. May his Reign be Long,
*109174*
[[S:::5490-6270]]
Prosperous,
*109175*
[[S:::6730-7500]]
and Filled with Peace”
*109176*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s165_020_mmr:11-1278]]
Two out of three isn’t bad.
*109177*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s165_030_son:70-1770]]
Did the people who lived here write this?
*109178*
[[S:::2720-3630]]
Strange…
*109179*
[[S:::4540-6250]]
I thought this king was supposed to be evil.
*109180*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s165_040_mmr:40-913]]
Evil to whom?
*109181*
[[S:::1300-3500]]
Sometimes it all depends where you’re standing.
*109182*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplhttk_s165_050_son:46-2284]]
Hmm… I wonder what happened to him?
*109183*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplnif_s005_010_mmr:0-1460]]
Ah, Niflheim.
*109184*
[[S:::1980-3910]]
Not sure why anyone would want to come here,
*109185*
[[S:::4260-5000]]
but… here we are.
*109186*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s005_020_son:36-1463]]
It smells bad.
*109187*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s010_010_son:31-2404]]
Blech… what is this stuff?
*109188*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplnif_s010_020_kra:20-1911]]
This mist is cursed.
*109189*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s010_030_son:24-646]]
Cursed?
*109190*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplnif_s010_040_mmr:0-3240]]
Quite right. Safe to breathe for a time, but it’ll kill if we linger.
*109191*
[[S:::3710-6210]]
Just one more reason to love Niflheim!
*109192*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s015_010_son:0-1140]]
What is that stuff?
*109193*
[[S:::2120-2500]]
Weird.
*109194*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplnif_s015_020_kra:37-2809]]
Yes. A strange material.
*109195*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s020_010_son:10-970]]
Let’s see…
*109196*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s025_010_son:1500-3090]]
This mist is making my head hurt.
*109197*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplnif_s025_020_mmr:60-1750]]
It’s also slowly killing you, lad.
*109198*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplnif_s025_030_kra:30-750]]
Quiet, head.
*109199*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplnif_s025_040_mmr:46-2057]]
I’m just saying… priorities!
*109200*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s030_010_sin:70-720]]
Ah,
*109201*
[[S:::1720-3250]]
fancy seeing you two here!
*109202*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s030_020_son:40-3250]]
I’m surprised you’re here, Sindri. This mist is pretty gross.
*109203*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s030_030_sin:0-3080]]
You think I can’t handle a little cursed mist? Well,
*109204*
[[S:::3630-4370]]
you’re right!
*109205*
[[S:::5081-8413]]
I’m trying to build some armour that will lessen its effects.
*109206*
[[S:::8716-12340]]
The materials I need are all right here in Ivaldi’s Workshop, but…
*109207*
[[S:::12946-16390]]
they’re blanketed by this nauseating mist, of course.
*109208*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplnif_s030_040_mmr:120-1209]]
Wait for it…
*109209*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s030_050_sin:140-4120]]
The last known location for such armour is in the Workshop’s centre chamber.
*109210*
[[S:::4610-9500]]
The entrance is sealed, but I could craft you an Entry Stone with enough Mist Echoes.
*109211*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplnif_s030_060_mmr:50-951]]
There it is.
*109212*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s030_070_sin:134-2604]]
I wouldn’t recommend staying in the mist for too long.
*109213*
[[S:::3120-6101]]
That stench will stick to your hair, your weapons, your armour…
*109214*
[[S:::6496-11500]]
and I will NOT touch your gear until you burn all the tiny beasties off in the fires of Muspelheim.
*109215*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s030_080_sin:30-1250]]
Also, it will kill you.
*109216*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s035_010_sin:87-3431]]
You shouldn’t have much trouble finding Mist Echoes inside the Workshop.
*109217*
[[S:::3431-5488]]
Staying alive on the other hand…
*109218*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s035_020_sin:80-2810]]
Ivaldi sure did a number on this place.
*109219*
[[S:::3400-5010]]
Not that there was much to see before…
*109220*
[[S:::5620-8500]]
Still, the Echoes remain, ready for plunder.
*109221*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s035_030_sin:50-3090]]
Just make sure you give yourself enough time while you’re hunting for Echoes.
*109222*
[[S:::3710-7500]]
I know you two get carried away, breaking pots and looting corpses.
*109223*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s040_010_son:38-1028]]
There’s something written here…
*109224*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s040_020_son:0-3937]]
This whole place shuffles around each time we leave? That’s incredible!
*109225*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplnif_s040_030_kra:70-1487]]
Atreus—focus.
*109226*
[[S:::1980-3646]]
This is a dangerous place.
*109227*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplnif_s040_040_mmr:48-3316]]
That’s Dwarven creativity for you. Impressive and dangerous.
*109228*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s040_050_son:53-1503]]
That must be the centre chamber.
*109229*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplnif_s040_060_kra:40-1420]]
We should return to the dwarf.
*109230*
[[S:::1800-4250]]
There will be valuable resources within that chamber.
*109231*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s040_070_son:0-750]]
How do you know that?
*109232*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplnif_s040_080_kra:140-1733]]
Intuition and experience.
*109233*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s045_010_sin:40-1800]]
Ooo. Looks like you found enough echoes.
*109234*
[[S:::2160-3080]]
AND you’re not dead!
*109235*
[[S:::3470-4250]]
Very impressive.
*109236*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s045_020_son:18-2833]]
Sindri, how do you make anything out of mist?
*109237*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s045_030_sin:0-5000]]
Odd as it sounds, the dwarves who lived here could craft marvels out of the mists of Niflheim.
*109238*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s045_040_sin:1380-2690]]
But that was a long time ago.
*109239*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s045_050_sin:90-1880]]
Keep an eye out for more Mist Echoes.
*109240*
[[S:::2380-4000]]
I could put them to all sorts of use.
*109241*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s050_010_son:68-705]]
Blech,
*109242*
[[S:::1367-2810]]
this mist makes my skin crawl.
*109243*
[[S:::3288-4300]]
Are you okay, Father?
*109244*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplnif_s050_020_kra:20-1368]]
I am fine, boy.
*109245*
[[S:::1550-2800]]
But we must be quick.
*109246*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s050_030_son:57-1143]]
Alright, we’re in!
*109247*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s055_010_son:50-1170]]
The mist is thinner up here.
*109248*
[[S:::1810-2300]]
That’s nice.
*109249*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s055_020_son:40-1010]]
Is that the armour?
*109250*
[[S:::1790-2990]]
It looks kinda run down…
*109251*
[[S:::3760-4450]]
Can you wear it?
*109252*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplnif_s055_030_kra:40-2750]]
No. It is too small, and too old.
*109253*
[[S:::3300-4750]]
We will bring it back to the dwarf.
*109254*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s060_010_sin:0-1170]]
Is that what I think it is?
*109255*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s060_020_son:0-940]]
Useless armour?
*109256*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s060_030_sin:0-870]]
Useless?!
*109257*
[[S:::1520-6250]]
Oh ye of little faith, this armour was worn by Ivaldi himself!
*109258*
[[S:::6630-8570]]
Sure, it’s seen better days…
*109259*
[[S:::9290-11660]]
but I can restore it with more Mist Echoes,
*109260*
[[S:::12060-14500]]
and it’ll help with the effects of Ivaldi’s Curse.
*109261*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplnif_s060_040_kra:80-4570]]
Unless there is something of value in this Workshop, there is little point in staying here.
*109262*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s060_050_sin:0-2345]]
You saw all the chests in the centre chamber, yes?
*109263*
[[S:::2482-5236]]
Plus all the goodies tucked away towards the back of the workshop.
*109264*
[[S:::5850-8060]]
AND the three Realm Tears, of course.
*109265*
[[S:::8640-11448]]
But… might want to be careful with those.
*109266*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s060_060_son:27-602]]
Why’s that?
*109267*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s060_070_sin:20-2780]]
It’s a literal tear in the fabric of reality itself!
*109268*
[[S:::3130-4510]]
You wanna reach your hand through there?
*109269*
[[S:::4870-5750]]
Be my guest.
*109270*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s065_010_sin:0-3000]]
Seriously, BE CAREFUL with those Realm Tears.
*109271*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s065_020_sin:30-5037]]
Supposedly, the Realm Tears contain some kind of terrible secret Ivaldi wanted hidden.
*109272*
[[S:::5221-7747]]
But who knows, really? Dwarves are strange. And
*109273*
[[S:::8213-10572]]
yes, I realise I’M a dwarf.
*109274*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s065_030_sin:110-2570]]
Need a fresh upgrade before tackling the Realm Tears?
*109275*
[[S:::2990-5150]]
Not that I condone such an action, mind you.
*109276*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s065_040_sin:70-1870]]
The spinning blades were Ivaldi’s favourite.
*109277*
[[S:::2880-4250]]
I always thought them a bit garish.
*109278*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s065_050_sin:50-2651]]
I see you’re actually ENJOYING Ivaldi’s workshop?
*109279*
[[S:::3060-4828]]
You’ve certainly spent enough time here.
*109280*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s070a_010_son:45-3612]]
We have enough Mist Echoes to open one of those Tears. Should we do it?
*109281*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplnif_s070a_020_mmr:30-1500]]
Very impressive, lads.
*109282*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s070a_030_son:48-1873]]
I’m kinda surprised we made it out of that one!
*109283*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s070b_010_son:0-1250]]
Time for the second Realm Tear?
*109284*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplnif_s070b_020_mmr:0-1718]]
You two just can’t get enough, can you?
*109285*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s070b_030_son:20-530]]
Phew!
*109286*
[[S:::1070-1750]]
That was rough!
*109287*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s070c_010_son:29-2774]]
This third one’s gonna be bad. I can feel it.
*109288*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplnif_s070c_020_mmr:40-4000]]
You did it! You sealed all three of the Realm Tears. How do you feel?
*109289*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s070c_030_son:13-1685]]
Like my fingers are about to fall off!
*109290*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplnif_s070c_040_kra:0-1840]]
You have come a long way, Atreus.
*109291*
[[S:::2370-3610]]
This was no easy feat.
*109292*
[[S:::4390-5250]]
You should feel pride.
*109293*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s070c_050_son:40-630]]
I do! …
*109294*
[[S:::1260-2000]]
Thank you, Father.
*109295*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s075_010_son:75-2969]]
Hey Sindri, guess what? We closed all the Realm Tears!
*109296*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s075_020_sin:30-850]]
You… what?
*109297*
[[S:::1780-3930]]
No you did not. You really did?
*109298*
[[S:::4390-5000]]
No way.
*109299*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s075_030_son:13-2986]]
Yes huh! It took forever, but we sealed ’em all up.
*109300*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s075_040_sin:30-960]]
I don’t believe it.
*109301*
[[S:::1380-2440]]
The strength you would need…
*109302*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplnif_s075_050_kra:30-1160]]
It is no boast.
*109303*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s075_060_sin:8-5330]]
No, I suppose you aren’t the type. Well… not much else I can say besides, “Thank you.”
*109304*
[[S:::5670-8067]]
Ivaldi and Sons would thank you too, were they here.
*109305*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s080_010_son:45-1730]]
(coughs) Father, the curse!
*109306*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s080_020_son:113-2046]]
(coughs) We should get out of here!
*109307*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s080_030_son:950-2100]]
(coughs) This mist is killing us!
*109308*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s080_040_son:136-2517]]
(coughs) We need some air, fast!
*109309*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplnif_s080_050_mmr:60-1500]]
Brother, you’re fading fast!
*109310*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplnif_s080_060_mmr:50-650]]
You two don’t look so good…
*109311*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplnif_s080_070_mmr:0-1750]]
Might want to start heading to a mist-free area.
*109312*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplnif_s080_080_mmr:59-1272]]
Brother, the curse!
*109313*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplnif_s080_090_mmr:59-1491]]
Brother, it’s time to go!
*109314*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s085_010_son:30-250]]
Wow, what a haul!
*109315*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s085_020_son:32-1822]]
Nice! That should help us out.
*109316*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s085_030_son:50-300]]
Wow! That one had a ton!
*109317*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s085_040_son:70-2450]]
Whoah, look at all those Mist Echoes!
*109318*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s085_050_son:0-600]]
Good find!
*109319*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s090_010_son:50-1287]]
What is this place?
*109320*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s090_020_sin:30-3020]]
You are standing at the entrance to Ivaldi’s Workshop;
*109321*
[[S:::3460-6250]]
a testament to the ingenuity of Dwarven engineering.
*109322*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s090_030_son:0-1372]]
Why does it smell so bad?
*109323*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s090_040_sin:50-1820]]
It is quite foul, isn’t it?
*109324*
[[S:::2640-5910]]
Well, that’s a long story. But uhhh. Quite simply:
*109325*
[[S:::6330-10500]]
Ivaldi messed with forces he shouldn’t have, and you’re breathing the consequences.
*109326*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s090_050_son:0-549]]
So,
*109327*
[[S:::817-2292]]
Ivaldi created this mist?
*109328*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s090_060_sin:110-3150]]
No no, Niflheim has always been a land of mist.
*109329*
[[S:::3630-9331]]
And snow. ENDLESS snow. And wind. And ice. Really, it’s never been a pleasant location.
*109330*
[[S:::9457-13260]]
But Ivaldi found a way to harness all that frosty power,
*109331*
[[S:::13640-17000]]
and built marvels that shocked the realms of both man and god.
*109332*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s090_070_son:28-684]]
Wow.
*109333*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s090_080_sin:30-620]]
Yes,
*109334*
[[S:::1110-1929]]
“Wow.”
*109335*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s090_090_son:29-1159]]
So then what happened?
*109336*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s090_100_sin:63-454]]
Hmm?
*109337*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplnif_s090_110_son:50-1701]]
After Ivaldi built all the marvels.
*109338*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplnif_s090_120_sin:40-1050]]
Ah yes, well…
*109339*
[[S:::1820-6001]]
Odin wasn’t keen on the idea of dwarves building contraptions that challenged his power.
*109340*
[[S:::6001-7200]]
So he intervened.
*109341*
[[S:::7650-11370]]
Ivaldi was furious, and retaliated. From there, things…
*109342*
[[S:::11900-13230]]
escalated – and well,
*109343*
[[S:::14060-15020]]
here we are!
*109344*
[[S:::15410-16372]]
Cursed mist!
*109345*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplnif_s090_130_kra:0-2250]]
And this is why gods are best avoided.
*109346*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s005_010_mmr:0-3250]]
Ah, Fafnir! I always wondered what became of him.
*109347*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s005_020_kra:60-1000]]
You know this dragon?
*109348*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s005_030_mmr:0-510]]
Yes;
*109349*
[[S:::890-2768]]
although he wasn’t a dragon when I knew him.
*109350*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s005_040_son:50-750]]
What do you mean?
*109351*
[[S:::1770-2500]]
What was he?
*109352*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s005_050_mmr:44-2457]]
A dwarf! A greedy little bugger.
*109353*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s005_060_son:20-1250]]
Not so little anymore.
*109354*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s005_070_mmr:0-4750]]
Perhaps we should keep an eye out for binding shrines and free the poor bastard, aye lads?
*109355*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s005_080_mmr:0-1507]]
Ah, Fafnir!
*109356*
[[S:::1790-3636]]
I always wondered what became of him.
*109357*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s005_090_son:30-1539]]
Wait; Fafnir?
*109358*
[[S:::2080-4604]]
Like, Fafnir’s Storeroom Fafnir?
*109359*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s005_100_mmr:70-1000]]
The very one.
*109360*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s005_110_son:58-1617]]
But Sindri said he was a dwarf!
*109361*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s005_120_mmr:0-550]]
He was!
*109362*
[[S:::980-2430]]
And now he’s a dragon.
*109363*
[[S:::2850-4500]]
Funny how life works, innit?
*109364*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s005_130_son:0-750]]
He’s chained up…
*109365*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s005_140_mmr:0-4250]]
Perhaps we should keep an eye out for binding shrines and free the poor bastard, aye lads?
*109366*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s010_010_son:45-1909]]
How did your friend become a dragon, Mimir?
*109367*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s010_020_mmr:130-1560]]
Oh, he’s no friend of mine.
*109368*
[[S:::2030-6440]]
This little scrote was a constant source of annoyance amongst Aesir and Vanir alike.
*109369*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s010_030_kra:0-1000]]
Then why free him?
*109370*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s010_040_mmr:0-4374]]
Trust the recently liberated, brother; No one deserves to be held captive like this.
*109371*
[[S:::4627-6756]]
Even a greedy little Dwarf-come-dragon.
*109372*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s015_010_kra:0-2090]]
You never answered the boy’s question, Head;
*109373*
[[S:::2610-4500]]
how did this dwarf become a dragon?
*109374*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s015_020_mmr:14-4991]]
Well, I don’t know for certain; though I’d wager his penchant for stealing magical artefacts had
*109375*
[[S:::4991-9095]]
something to do with it. Must’ve stolen a trinket from the wrong Vanir goddess.
*109376*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s020_010_son:50-1080]]
Time to set him free.
*109377*
[[S:::2054-2996]]
Think he’ll remember you?
*109378*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s020_020_mmr:44-4539]]
I don’t know, lad. A lot’s changed since we last crossed paths. I had legs!
*109379*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s025_010_mmr:0-1980]]
There you go, you wee little bugger.
*109380*
[[S:::2330-3196]]
Be free.
*109381*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_xplfaf_s025_020_mmr:0-3310]]
Well! Turning dragon hasn’t done much for his personality.
*109382*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xpltbh_s010_010_son:20-1580]]
That troll was Daudi Kaupmadr,
*109383*
[[S:::2590-3460]]
the Death Merchant.
*109384*
[[S:::4830-6340]]
Mother taught me about all the trolls.
*109385*
[[S:::6950-10020]]
She said they were evil and meant nothing but harm to anything living.
*109386*
[[S:::11260-12170]]
I think I know why.
*109387*
[[S:::13110-15000]]
No one is safe with trolls running around.
*109388*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xpltbh_s020_010_son:70-1120]]
That was Brenna Daudi,
*109389*
[[S:::1860-2830]]
the Burning Death.
*109390*
[[S:::3720-5640]]
I think I understand why they call him that now.
*109391*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xpltbh_s030_010_son:0-880]]
Frost Trolls.
*109392*
[[S:::1490-2500]]
I really don’t like Frost Trolls.
*109393*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xpltbh_s030_020_son:40-2040]]
That was one of the worst of the Frost Trolls,
*109394*
[[S:::2640-3820]]
Marthok Stormbjorn.
*109395*
[[S:::4660-7370]]
Mother said he fought Thor once AND lived to tell about it.
*109396*
[[S:::8030-9230]]
If Thor couldn’t beat him,
*109397*
[[S:::9950-11750]]
guess that means we are really strong.
*109398*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xpltbh_s040_010_son:70-1300]]
The Stonebeard King.
*109399*
[[S:::2190-3410]]
He said he was un-killable.
*109400*
[[S:::4340-5160]]
Guess he was wrong.
*109401*
[[S:::6030-7500]]
We are the ones who are un-killable.
*109402*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xpltbh_s040_020_son:0-1310]]
All I sense from them is hate.
*109403*
[[S:::2030-2870]]
So much hate.
*109404*
[[S:::4030-5900]]
I don’t hate them as much as they hate us.
*109405*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xpltbh_s050_010_son:0-1320]]
You killed the Son of Hel?
*109406*
[[S:::2320-3830]]
From the stories mother told me,
*109407*
[[S:::4390-5500]]
that could not have been easy.
*109408*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xpltbh_s060_010_son:50-2200]]
I can’t believe we just fought Grendel of the Mountain.
*109409*
[[S:::3090-4500]]
Even mother did not think he was real.
*109410*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xpltbh_s060_020_son:36-4936]]
These trolls are big, but they’re all less than us, aren’t they? We’re better than them.
*109411*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xpltbh_s070_010_son:40-420]]
Whew,
*109412*
[[S:::1550-2520]]
that was not easy—
*109413*
[[S:::3380-4750]]
but take two more off the list.
*109414*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xpltbh_s070_020_son:0-730]]
Deaths Heart.
*109415*
[[S:::1600-2170]]
I wonder…
*109416*
[[S:::2990-4100]]
if their names were different,
*109417*
[[S:::4890-6450]]
maybe the trolls wouldn’t be so angry.
*109418*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xpltbh_s080_010_son:14-8448]]
I’m glad this one is dead. He was the Death Eater, mother said he was known for… well… you know.
*109419*
[[S:::8448-8969]]
Gross.
*109420*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xpltbh_s090_010_son:60-970]]
Death’s Hammer.
*109421*
[[S:::1870-5950]]
Mother told me once that he would burn entire forests just to hear the animals die.
*109422*
[[S:::7360-8250]]
I hate trolls.
*109423*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xpltbh_s110_010_brk:0-2430]]
I see you hate trolls as much as me.
*109424*
[[S:::2830-6430]]
You end up killing all them trolls, you come back and see me.
*109425*
[[S:::6800-8250]]
I’ll make you something special.
*109426*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xpltbh_s110_020_brk:120-6000]]
Hey, I got a bounty on the trolls. You manage to kill all them filthy fuckers, come back and see
*109427*
[[S:::6000-8540]]
me. I’ll make sure something good comes out of it.
*109428*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xpltbh_s120_010_brk:100-2000]]
Still a few more trolls left.
*109429*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xpltbh_s120_020_brk:0-1900]]
Take care of my troll problem, yet?
*109430*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xpltbh_s120_030_brk:30-3000]]
Almost got all them trolls.  Keep at it!
*109431*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xpltbh_s130_010_brk:40-960]]
You got ’em all?
*109432*
[[S:::1360-3360]]
Good. World’s better without ’em.
*109433*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xpltbh_s130_020_brk:30-2910]]
I told you, something good came out all that work.
*109434*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xpltbh_s130_030_brk:0-2000]]
Trolls make great armour.
*109435*
[[S:::2360-5250]]
Horrible fucking beasts. But great armour.
*109436*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplaq_s005_010_son:33-951]]
What do we do with that?
*109437*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplaq_s005_020_kra:21-2892]]
Hmm… We will show it to the Dwarves.
*109438*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplaq_s007_010_son:7-1217]]
What did the Spirit leave us?
*109439*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplaq_s007_020_kra:30-1750]]
An offering to one of the gods.
*109440*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplaq_s007_030_son:3-623]]
Can we use it?
*109441*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplaq_s007_040_kra:30-500]]
No.
*109442*
[[S:::910-2000]]
But perhaps the dwarves can.
*109443*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplaq_s010_010_son:46-2499]]
Hey Brok, we found something interesting.
*109444*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplaq_s010_020_brk:0-3000]]
Didja now? Well colour me interested.
*109445*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplaq_s010_030_son:16-2371]]
Hey Brok, could you take a look at this?
*109446*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplaq_s010_040_brk:0-1473]]
Whatcha got for ol’ Brok?
*109447*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplaq_s010_050_son:27-1783]]
Hey Brok, we found something –
*109448*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplaq_s010_060_brk:250-2551]]
Lemme guess:  Something I can build with?
*109449*
[[S:::2910-4153]]
How’d I know?
*109450*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplaq_s010_070_son:0-620]]
Hey Brok!
*109451*
[[S:::881-1862]]
Take a look at this thing!
*109452*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplaq_s010_080_brk:19-844]]
Phrasing!
*109453*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplaq_s010_090_son:37-433]]
Huh?
*109454*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplaq_s010_100_brk:0-2000]]
Oh, never you mind. Whatcha got?
*109455*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplaq_s015_010_son:100-2339]]
Hey Sindri, we found something interesting.
*109456*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplaq_s015_020_sin:0-2220]]
Oh really? I love something interesting.
*109457*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplaq_s015_030_son:0-650]]
Hey Sindri,
*109458*
[[S:::1177-2299]]
could you take a look at this?
*109459*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplaq_s015_040_sin:0-611]]
Honestly?
*109460*
[[S:::950-2586]]
I don’t have much else going on right now.
*109461*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplaq_s015_050_son:46-1838]]
Hey Sindri, we found something –
*109462*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplaq_s015_060_sin:0-610]]
Armour piece?
*109463*
[[S:::1000-2750]]
Ohh I hope it’s a new armour piece.
*109464*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplaq_s015_070_son:49-1855]]
Hey Sindri, check this out!
*109465*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplaq_s015_080_sin:40-3250]]
My, we’re excited to spend some hacksilver, aren’t we?
*109466*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplaq_s020_010_brk:0-4250]]
Týr woulda been pleased as peaches knowin’ these offerins were bein turnt to armour.
*109467*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplaq_s020_020_son:0-600]]
Did you know him?
*109468*
[[S:::1300-2000]]
What was he like?
*109469*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplaq_s020_030_brk:0-1470]]
Never you mind, boy.
*109470*
[[S:::2050-3150]]
Týr’s dead.
*109471*
[[S:::3630-5220]]
Best not to dig up the past.
*109472*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplaq_s020_040_kra:122-1710]]
The dwarf speaks wisely.
*109473*
[[S:::2031-3005]]
For once.
*109474*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplaq_s020_050_sin:0-3500]]
Ah, Offerings to Týr. These are quite rare, you know.
*109475*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplaq_s020_060_son:13-540]]
Why?
*109476*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplaq_s020_070_sin:0-2520]]
Well, you know Odin… Not the biggest fan of Týr.
*109477*
[[S:::2890-4500]]
I thought he’d destroyed all of these.
*109478*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplaq_s025_010_sin:410-770]]
WHOAH –
*109479*
[[S:::1310-3000]]
you killed an Ancient?
*109480*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplaq_s025_020_kra:24-709]]
Yes.
*109481*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplaq_s025_030_sin:48-1485]]
Was it…
*109482*
[[S:::1530-2250]]
difficult?
*109483*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplaq_s025_040_kra:14-674]]
Yes.
*109484*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplaq_s025_050_sin:0-500]]
Is that…
*109485*
[[S:::1380-2710]]
all you’re going to give me?
*109486*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplaq_s025_060_kra:24-692]]
…Yes.
*109487*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplaq_s025_070_brk:0-2500]]
Holy Heimdall! Do you know what this is?
*109488*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_xplaq_s025_080_kra:30-1000]]
The heart of an Ancient.
*109489*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplaq_s025_090_brk:48-4397]]
The heart of an – Oh. Yeah.  Well… That’s what it is.
*109490*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplaq_s025_100_son:26-1245]]
It wasn’t easy to kill.
*109491*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplaq_s025_110_brk:90-4539]]
Oh really? Giant monster made outta rocks don’t go down easy?
*109492*
[[S:::5025-5898]]
Shocker.
*109493*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplaq_s030_010_sin:1490-3660]]
Ughff, the Travellers. Woahgff, Disgusting.
*109494*
[[S:::4340-7720]]
Ughff, Smelly. Covered in god knows how many little beasties. But
*109495*
[[S:::8180-9190]]
gorgeous armour!
*109496*
[[S:::9880-13090]]
Let’s see if I can’t make something more sanitary,
*109497*
[[S:::13550-13870]]
yes?
*109498*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplaq_s030_020_brk:0-2440]]
See you boys ran afoul of some Travellers.
*109499*
[[S:::2880-5760]]
Or them Travellers ran afoul of you, more like…
*109500*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplaq_s030_030_son:0-650]]
Who are they?
*109501*
[[S:::1180-1910]]
What do they want?
*109502*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplaq_s030_040_brk:0-620]]
Dunno!
*109503*
[[S:::1700-3500]]
BOY you ask a lot a questions.
*109504*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplaq_s035_010_brk:0-4430]]
Oooh well lookey-here! A Smoulderin’ Ember!
*109505*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplaq_s035_020_son:16-540]]
What is it?
*109506*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplaq_s035_030_brk:0-5400]]
You get lava in your ears, boy? I just toldya; a SMOULDERIN’ EMBER.
*109507*
[[S:::6030-8310]]
More’n likely from Surtr hisself.
*109508*
[[S:::8830-9470]]
Tell you what;
*109509*
[[S:::9910-11850]]
I’mma build some armour with it.
*109510*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplaq_s035_040_sin:23-2718]]
Hoo, that’s hot! Why’s that so hot?!
*109511*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplaq_s035_050_son:2-892]]
It’s from Muspelheim!
*109512*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_lvl_xplaq_s035_060_sin:0-1490]]
Oh! Well, that answers that.
*109513*
[[S:::2480-4250]]
You want me to build something out of it?
*109514*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplaq_s040_010_brk:0-2500]]
Been putzing around Niflheim, have we?
*109515*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_xplaq_s040_020_son:40-870]]
How can you tell?
*109516*
[[S:BROK:vo_lvl_xplaq_s040_030_brk:52-6845]]
I’d recognise Ivaldi’s stench o’ failure anywhere. Plus, you still got some mist on yer shoes.
*109517*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_lotw_s010_010_son:3-652]]
Kveikja!
*109518*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_lotw_s010_020_son:0-310]]
Well…
*109519*
[[S:::910-1500]]
worth a shot.
*109520*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_lotw_s015_010_mmr:50-4460]]
Týr’s Braziers — a symbol of the light that binds all realms together.
*109521*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_lotw_s015_020_son:0-1730]]
Why would he use those strange runes, though?
*109522*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_lotw_s015_030_mmr:60-1210]]
Now that you mention it…
*109523*
[[S:::1820-2680]]
he wouldn’t.
*109524*
[[S:::3220-3680]]
Hmm…
*109525*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_lotw_s020_010_son:0-4606]]
Ah! I can read what this says now… but… it’s a name.
*109526*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_lotw_s020_020_son:1-506]]

Göndul!

Hildr!

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_lotw_s020_100_son:10-2219]]
Whoa! The name made it light up…!
*109535*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_lotw_s020_110_kra:0-1250]]
It is not a name I know.
*109536*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_lotw_s020_120_son:0-760]]
Me neither.
*109537*
[[S:::1510-1750]]
Hunh.
*109538*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_lotw_s020_130_mmr:30-1940]]
It’s the name of one of the Valkyries.
*109539*
[[S:::2410-3250]]
That’s quite curious.
*109540*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_lotw_s025_010_son:6-820]]
Another name…
*109541*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_lotw_s025_020_son:5-511]]
Gunnr!
*109542*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_lotw_s025_030_son:4-552]]

Hildr!
*109549*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_lotw_s025_100_mmr:30-1940]]
It’s the name of one of the Valkyries.
*109550*
[[S:::2410-3250]]
That’s quite curious.
*109551*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_lotw_s025_110_mmr:20-1010]]
Another Valkyrie.
*109552*
[[S:::1490-2580]]
That’s no coincidence.
*109553*
[[S:::3140-5500]]
But who’d have etched them on Týr’s Braziers?
*109554*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_lotw_s025_120_mmr:31-3066]]
It’s as if they’ve been made into a memorial to the Valkyries…
*109555*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_lotw_s025_130_mmr:0-2610]]
Someone who loved the Valkyries enough to do this…
*109556*
[[S:::3740-4520]]
I wonder…
*109557*
[[S:::5200-6000]]
perhaps the queen?
*109558*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_lotw_s025_140_mmr:50-1680]]
Why the arcane runes…?
*109559*
[[S:::2170-5250]]
Perhaps we’re meant to find something in Muspelheim and Niflheim…?
*109560*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_lotw_s025_150_mmr:60-1290]]
The arcane runes…
*109561*
[[S:::1650-6000]]
They must have been cluing us to look for Valkyries imprisoned in Muspelheim and Niflheim…!
*109562*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_lotw_s025_160_son:0-590]]
Hunh…
*109563*
[[S:::1520-2850]]
that’s all the ones I see…
*109564*
[[S:::4120-7000]]
how are we supposed to light the braziers on a tower that’s not there?
*109565*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_lotw_s030_010_son:80-1370]]
Alright, last one!
*109566*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_lotw_s030_020_son:5-511]]
Gunnr!
*109567*

Hildr!
*109574*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_lotw_s030_100_son:38-3688]]
Look at that! Maybe we can survive a fight with a Valkyrie now…
*109575*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_lotw_s030_110_son:15-4114]]
Look! That should really help us fight the rest of the corrupted Valkyries.
*109576*

I think that might be Odin stabbing him.

Aesir slaying Jötnar.

[[S:::1470-2250]]
How did you know her?
*117471*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_axe_for_mother_040_sin:90-2070]]
She sought us out, in the beginning.
*117472*
[[S:::2780-3450]]
She was…
*117473*
[[S:::4500-5370]]
a special woman.
*117474*
[[S:::6400-7840]]
She wanted to protect people.
*117475*
[[S:::9040-12770]]
I suppose we thought it was a chance to give power to someone who’d use it for good.
*117476*
[[S:::13590-16070]]
She even spoke our native tongue. She’d say,
*117477*
[[S:::17310-18890]]
“Maðurinn sem gengur
*117478*
[[S:::19800-21250]]
eigin vegum hans…”
*117479*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_axe_for_mother_060_son:54-1276]]
… gengur einn.
*117480*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_axe_for_mother_080_sin:130-940]]
That’s right!
*117481*
[[S:::1460-2470]]
That's impressive.
*117482*
[[S:::3350-4950]]
I see a lot of her in your eyes,
*117483*
[[S:::5800-6250]]
you know.
*117484*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_axe_for_mother_090_son:48-747]]
Thanks, Sind—
*117485*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_axe_for_mother_100_sin:96-1007]]
Don’t touch me!
*117486*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_axe_for_mother_110_son:50-430]]
What? I didn’t! I won’t.
*117487*
[[S:::790-3950]]
I’ll come back later…
*117488*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_wash_symbol_010_sin:60-5000]]
Um… I know it’s not my business, but if I were you I’d wash off that symbol painted on your neck.
*117489*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_wash_symbol_020_kra:0-1960]]
We were told it would help protect us.
*117490*
[[S:::2500-3250]]
Was that a lie?
*117491*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_wash_symbol_030_sin:50-3100]]
Oh no, it’s a protection stave alright. But…
*117492*
[[S:::3630-7850]]
you can’t render that pigment into paintable texture without blending it with boar urine.
*117493*
[[S:::8690-10500]]
And is that really better than death?
*117494*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_wash_symbol_040_son:0-750]]
Maybe a little…?
*117495*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_wash_symbol_050_sin:1010-1750]]
Well… it’s your neck.
*117496*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_wash_symbol_060_sin:94-999]]
Myeeeaaah.
*117497*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_tiny_beasties_010_son:180-610]]
Sindri,
*117498*
[[S:::1060-2250]]
have you always been so…
*117499*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_tiny_beasties_020_sin:73-794]]
Clean?
*117500*
[[S:::1015-1442]]
Hunh,
*117501*
[[S:::1869-2737]]
don’t I wish.
*117502*
[[S:::3266-8791]]
No, I was just as unsanitary as the next dwarf until the day a Vanir witch set me straight.
*117503*
[[S:::9187-13044]]
She discovered with her magic that there are hundreds of thousands of tiny
*117504*
[[S:::13193-15046]]
beasties on everything around us…
*117505*
[[S:::15612-17589]]
so small, you can’t even see them!
*117506*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_tiny_beasties_030_son:28-1100]]
No…
*117507*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_tiny_beasties_040_sin:170-940]]
It’s true.
*117508*
[[S:::1460-3160]]
And if they get inside you,
*117509*
[[S:::3570-4610]]
they make you sick.
*117510*
[[S:::5270-8380]]
But the witch told me there’s one wood… the oak…
*117511*
[[S:::8380-12000]]
that’s a natural deterrent, stops the beasties from spreading. So now…
*117512*
[[S:::12410-14262]]
I make all my handles from oak.
*117513*
[[S:::14399-15061]]
See,
*117514*
[[S:::15300-16710]]
I think of these things.
*117515*
[[S:::17340-18750]]
Ok! Back to work…
*117516*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_touching_silver_010_son:30-1750]]
So how come Brok’s blue and you’re not?
*117517*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_touching_silver_020_kra:34-577]]
Boy!
*117518*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_touching_silver_020_kra_a:40-600]]
Boy!
*117519*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_touching_silver_030_sin:150-6060]]
Oh, it’s fine—very good question actually. You see, my brother’s not as careful as I am—in fact,
*117520*
[[S:::6060-7750]]
he prefers to work with metals using…
*117521*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_touching_silver_040_sin:940-2560]]
… his own bare hands.
*117522*
[[S:::4160-8270]]
No gloves! Says it’s the only way he can “hear what it wants to be.”
*117523*
[[S:::8870-12510]]
Touch enough raw silver and it changes your skin irreparably.
*117524*
[[S:::12940-13950]]
(That means forever!)
*117525*
[[S:::14930-16810]]
I wouldn’t bring it up to him though.
*117526*
[[S:::17800-19450]]
You know how sensitive he can be.
*117527*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_touching_silver_050_son:38-1162]]
I guess that makes sense.
*117528*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_touching_silver_050_son_a:34-1126]]
I guess that makes sense.
*117529*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_change_or_die_010_son:50-1811]]
Where’d you learn how to do that, Sindri?
*117530*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_change_or_die_010_son_a:38-1790]]
Where’d you learn how to do that, Sindri?
*117531*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_change_or_die_020_sin:200-2000]]
Well, after  Brok and I
*117532*
[[S:::2460-3610]]
parted ways,
*117533*
[[S:::3970-7750]]
I undertook some study in Vanaheim. Truly mind-expanding.
*117534*
[[S:::8370-12010]]
Now and then, I need new inspiration to grow creatively.
*117535*
[[S:::12600-14350]]
Part of why we split up, my brother and I.
*117536*
[[S:::14740-18440]]
He’s stuck in his ways, so our work stagnated.
*117537*
[[S:::19000-21360]]
Sure, we mastered weapon-making, but then what?
*117538*
[[S:::22160-25737]]
Change is a part of life—if you can’t adapt, and learn to thrive,
*117539*
[[S:::25923-27241]]
you’ll be left in the dust,
*117540*
[[S:::28220-29416]]
and that’s filthy!
*117541*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_change_or_die_030_son:0-450]]
Okay.
*117542*
[[S:::940-1700]]
Until next time…
*117543*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_sindri_meets_mimir_010_son:0-740]]
Hey Sindri,
*117544*
[[S:::1090-1750]]
have you met Mimir?
*117545*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_meets_mimir_020_sin:2090-5460]]
If you mean the severed head that keeps blinking at me, please
*117546*
[[S:::5830-6530]]
keep it away.
*117547*
[[S:::7080-8930]]
There’s no possible way that’s hygienic.
*117548*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_sindri_meets_mimir_030_mmr:7-1454]]
Ach! That’s nice.
*117549*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_sindri_meets_mimir_040_mmr:0-1500]]
Lovely to see you too, Sindri!
*117550*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_sindri_meets_mimir_050_mmr:50-869]]
Knob.
*117551*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_skap_slag_fever_010_son:50-1250]]
So what’re you doing up here—?
*117552*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_skap_slag_fever_020_sin:80-2500]]
I’m on a hunt—for skap slag.
*117553*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_skap_slag_fever_030_son:40-750]]
Slap what?
*117554*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_skap_slag_fever_040_sin:190-1830]]
Skap. Slag.
*117555*
[[S:::2430-7270]]
Ores with specific impurities that are the key to unlocking all sorts of unique qualities.
*117556*
[[S:::7630-10750]]
One man’s waste-product is another man’s artistic medium!
*117557*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_skap_slag_fever_050_son:0-900]]
Oo-kay.
*117558*
[[S:::1750-2150]]
Well,
*117559*
[[S:::2720-4900]]
we’re off to get a chunk from the tip of the Giant’s chisel.
*117560*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_skap_slag_fever_060_sin:130-1570]]
The big chisel buried under all the ice?
*117561*
[[S:::1940-2320]]
Ha,
*117562*
[[S:::2800-3500]]
good luck with that!
*117563*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_skap_slag_fever_050_son_a:30-990]]
Oo-kay.
*117564*
[[S:::2070-5124]]
Well, we’re off to get a chunk from the tip of the Giant’s chisel.
*117565*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_on_magni_010_sin:380-1977]]
Hey, did you hear?
*117566*
[[S:::2416-5168]]
Magni, the Aesir God, son of Thor? Dead!
*117567*
[[S:::5520-6319]]
I know!
*117568*
[[S:::6640-8950]]
Now Modi’s on a rampage across Midgard,
*117569*
[[S:::9123-12400]]
looking for the killer, swearing that once he finds him he’ll
*117570*
[[S:::12400-14067]]
oh shit that was you guys.
*117571*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_sindri_on_magni_020_son:40-2500]]
We… should probably discuss that more quietly.
*117572*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_on_magni_030_sin:100-1130]]
Or not at all.
*117573*
[[S:::1620-3000]]
I think that’s a great plan.
*117574*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_still_served_010_sin:60-500]]
Well…
*117575*
[[S:::1260-1750]]

*117576*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_still_served_020_sin:50-580]]
Okay.
*117577*
[[S:::1890-2960]]
I hope that was helpful.
*117578*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_still_served_030_sin:33-2734]]
If you’ll pardon me. Much to tidy…
*117579*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_enter_purchase_010_sin:30-1500]]
Oh, I could sell you things!
*117580*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_enter_purchase_020_sin:30-1180]]
What can I interest you in?
*117581*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_enter_purchase_030_sin:40-500]]
You need more?
*117582*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_enter_purchase_040_sin:70-920]]
Look all you want.
*117583*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_enter_purchase_050_sin:30-750]]
Take your time.
*117584*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_enter_purchase_060_sin:110-1500]]
OR I could sell you something…!
*117585*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_enter_purchase_070_sin:0-1250]]
Here’s the rest, have a look…
*117586*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_enter_purchase_080_sin:40-1500]]
If it’s here, it’s yours.
*117587*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_enter_purchase_090_sin:40-1380]]
Sure, treat yourself!
*117588*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_enter_purchase_100_sin:40-1500]]
I knew you’d want some of these…
*117589*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_enter_purchase_110_sin:20-1020]]
I guess I’ll just
*117590*
[[S:::1160-3250]]
stand here ’til you’re done looking…
*117591*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_enter_purchase_120_sin:50-2000]]
Sure you’re interested in what I’ve got?
*117592*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_enter_purchase_130_sin:20-2180]]
Sure you wouldn’t be happier at my brother’s shop?
*117593*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_gen_armor_010_sin:30-1500]]
Oh, a fine fit!
*117594*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_gen_armor_020_sin:30-2250]]
Ooh. I’m legitimately jealous.
*117595*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_gen_armor_030_sin:0-1500]]
I hope you like this colour scheme.
*117596*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_gen_armor_040_sin:40-1750]]
Functional and beautiful.
*117597*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_gen_armor_050_sin:0-1750]]
Oh, that’s quite good.
*117598*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_gen_armor_060_sin:80-3000]]
Has anyone told you you’re unreasonably tall?
*117599*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_gen_armor_070_sin:510-1750]]
Looking sharp, big fella.
*117600*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_gen_armor_080_sin:43-2293]]
Faye’s type. Who knew?
*117601*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_gen_armor_090_sin:0-1450]]
Keep your armour strong. That’s
*117602*
[[S:::2240-2750]]
good advice.
*117603*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_gen_armor_100_sin:420-2250]]
It’s almost like having a thick skin.

Mm! Better than ever.

[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_gen_weapon_030_sin:0-830]]
Aah…
*117608*
[[S:::1330-2750]]
still got it, Sindri…
*117609*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_gen_weapon_040_sin:50-2250]]
A work of art, if I say so myself.
*117610*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_gen_weapon_050_sin:0-240]]
Ah—
*117611*
[[S:::1080-2500]]

Can I just say, it’s a sad day for your enemies.
*117613*

Now it’s got that Sindri something.

Use it well, friends.
*117615*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_gen_weapon_090_sin:70-740]]
Careful now…
*117616*
[[S:::1540-3470]]
you could really hurt someone with that.
*117617*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_gen_weapon_100_sin:20-490]]
Well.
*117618*
[[S:::1130-2250]]
Have fun doing damage!
*117619*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_gen_weapon_110_sin:30-1700]]
I know you know what to do with that.

Don’t let the Draugr get you!

Was there more to discuss?
*117630*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_exit_sale_110_sin:50-1750]]
Was there more? Let me think…
*117631*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_exit_sale_120_sin:62-1835]]
You don’t have to run off on my account…
*117632*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_exit_sale_130_sin:30-1500]]
If you’re not in a hurry…
*117633*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_exit_sale_140_sin:0-2250]]
Now is there something else to tell you…?
*117634*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_exit_sale_150_sin:60-1200]]
What else was there…?
*117635*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_exit_sale_160_sin:0-1000]]
Was there something else?
*117636*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_not_notice_010_sin:40-1260]]
Be careful where you’re going.
*117637*
[[S:::2080-5370]]
There’s nobody nice out here anymore since all the people left. I mean,

[[S:::5830-7510]]

*117639*
[[S:::8070-9250]]
mostly they just try to kill you.
*117640*

Good tip.
*117641*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_sindri_blames_me_010_son:0-570]]
Sindri,
*117642*
[[S:::1550-3300]]
why don’t you just make up with your brother already?
*117643*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_blames_me_020_sin:0-410]]
Me?
*117644*
[[S:::890-1760]]
Make up with him?
*117645*
[[S:::2570-5640]]
Because he’s an obstinate pig-head, incapable of change.
*117646*
[[S:::6120-11000]]
Because he says the most terrible things about me, just because he’s insecure about his own work—
*117647*
[[S:::11000-13620]]
which, let me tell you, is sub-par.
*117648*
[[S:::14300-15720]]
Because he blames me for—
*117649*
[[S:::16780-18107]]

[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_blames_me_040_sin:1780-3320]]
Would you pardon me please?
*117653*
[[S:::3900-4890]]
I’d like to collect myself.
*117654*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_mind_peak_010_sin:270-980]]
Before you go—!
*117655*
[[S:::2130-4220]]
See that you take special care near the peak.
*117656*
[[S:::5138-7778]]
I’m pretty sure Odin is protecting something up there,
*117657*
[[S:::7878-10067]]
and you don’t wanna get on the Aesir’s bad side.
*117658*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_sindri_mind_peak_020_son:38-1091]]
Who, us?
*117659*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_sindri_legend_run_010_son:0-460]]
So…
*117660*
[[S:::1290-2750]]
I heard that you and Brok are kinda famous.
*117661*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_legend_run_020_sin:40-1650]]
Well, you’re half right.
*117662*
[[S:::2720-3750]]
Whatever did you hear?
*117663*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_sindri_legend_run_030_son:32-1256]]
That you made Thor’s hammer.
*117664*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_legend_run_040_sin:0-530]]
Oh—
*117665*
[[S:::1550-2130]]
yes…
*117666*
[[S:::2550-3390]]
we did do that.
*117667*
[[S:::4710-6140]]
Mjölnir put us on the map.
*117668*
[[S:::7010-9930]]
It was a legendary run. Gods and kings knew our brand.
*117669*
[[S:::10980-12400]]
We really did make quite a team.
*117670*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_sindri_legend_run_050_son:46-883]]
So what happened?
*117671*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_legend_run_060_sin:60-1230]]
Oh, well…
*117672*
[[S:::1910-3470]]
that’s a long story.
*117673*
[[S:::4260-5200]]
Things happened that…
*117674*
[[S:::5690-6710]]
made it difficult to…
*117675*
[[S:::8510-9990]]
find that certain spark, you know?
*117676*
[[S:::11570-13750]]
Inspiration is a fickle mistress.
*117677*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_sindri_legend_run_070_son:24-461]]
Huh?
*117678*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_legend_run_080_sin:240-1680]]
Enough distractions—
*117679*
[[S:::2370-4250]]
you see the mess I have to clean up around here…
*117680*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_sindri_comes_clean_010_son:0-690]]
Sindri…
*117681*
[[S:::1600-3630]]
I know I should stay out of your family business…
*117682*
[[S:::4060-7500]]
I just don’t get why Thor abusing your creation would drive you and Brok apart.
*117683*
[[S:::8640-9480]]
It wasn’t your fault.
*117684*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_comes_clean_020_sin:60-750]]
Well… I’m
*117685*
[[S:::1670-3220]]
glad you forgive us our part in that.
*117686*
[[S:::4390-7090]]
But when you’ve witnessed that much devastation and loss,
*117687*
[[S:::7900-9400]]
and you know it couldn’t have happened without you…
*117688*
[[S:::10790-13020]]
it’s simply not so easy to forgive yourself.
*117689*
[[S:::13810-14630]]
Or your partner.
*117690*
[[S:::16880-18700]]
We tried to make up for it, of course…
*117691*
[[S:::18780-20810]]
but that’s a whole other sad story,
*117692*
[[S:::21850-22750]]
as I’m sure you know.
*117693*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_sindri_comes_clean_030_son:20-500]]

Atreus. Enough.
*117695*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_sindri_comes_clean_050_son:24-735]]
All right…
*117696*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_butt_hurt_010_sin:79-2421]]
I’d like to focus on my work, if you don’t mind…
*117697*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_butt_hurt_020_sin:60-1410]]
I think maybe it’s better if I just work…
*117698*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_butt_hurt_030_sin:30-2010]]
I could use some quiet while I work,
*117699*
[[S:::2450-3000]]
actually….
*117700*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_sindri_alone_again_010_son:0-5060]]
I didn’t think we’d see you out here, since you and Brok got back together. Everything ok?
*117701*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_alone_again_020_sin:0-2820]]
Oh, better than ever.  You know,
*117702*
[[S:::3340-6250]]
I really think we’ve both grown in our years apart.
*117703*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_sindri_alone_again_030_son:80-1250]]
So how come you’re back here?
*117704*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_alone_again_040_sin:250-4830]]
Just catching some fresh air. Look, I love my brother,
*117705*
[[S:::5580-7500]]
but he still smells like a fetid dungpile.
*117706*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_sindri_thor_sons_010_kra:50-2000]]
Those men. What do you know of them?
*117707*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_thor_sons_020_sin:0-4700]]
First, they’re not men. They’re gods. Well—demi-gods anyway. Let’s see…
*117708*
[[S:::5060-10680]]
Thor’s their dad. Different moms—sordid story, that one. Baldur’s their uncle, Odin, dear ol’ Grandpa.
*117709*
[[S:::10717-12437]]
Oh, and a sister named—
*117710*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_sindri_thor_sons_kra:0-2000]]
Weapons. How do they fight?
*117711*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_sindri_thor_sons_sin:0-310]]
Oh.
*117712*
[[S:::750-1520]]
Of course.
*117713*
[[S:::2000-4730]]
Magni’s strong—really strong.
*117714*
[[S:::5210-9020]]
Carries a huge sword hardened by cyclonic thunder. And Modi? Ecch.
*117715*
[[S:::10320-12867]]
I’d sooner lick a rat than shake that dung heap’s hand.
*117716*
[[S:::13258-17151]]
His mace and shield’s just a cheap knockoff of my elegant work on their dad’s hammer.
*117717*
[[S:::17825-22013]]
Best to follow my lead and avoid. But who am I talking to?
*117718*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_sindri_alfheim_010_kra:30-2160]]
How are you here before us, dwarf?
*117719*

We were told our path was the only one between realms.
*117720*

It may be the only way for you to travel. But we dwarves are full of surprises.
*117721*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_sindri_alfheim_030_kra:30-1250]]

The hare is too confident of victory, and foolish,

[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_scorpion_resume03_010_son:20-2000]]

Yes…
*118582*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_scorpion_resume04_010_son:40-1460]]

[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_scorpion_secbrk02_010_kra:70-2000]]
The scorpion asked a frog for help.
*118589*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_scorpion_secbrk03_010_kra:50-5000]]
He told the frog that if he gave him a ride across the river on his back, he would be rewarded.
*118590*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_scorpion_secbrk04_010_kra:50-3130]]
The frog protested, fearing the scorpion would sting him.
*118591*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_scorpion_secbrk05_010_kra:20-4500]]
The scorpion assured the frog that he would not sting him or they would both drown in the river.
*118592*

The Frog agreed,
*118593*

[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_scorpion_secbrk07_010_kra:20-5000]]
The frog was mortally wounded and they both sunk to the bottom of the river and perished.

[[S:::1510-3000]]
It is his nature to do harm.

[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_in_war_secbrk06_010_kra:0-3750]]
Wars are fought for two things… survival, or advantage.
*118616*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_in_war_secbrk07_010_kra:0-2210]]
Battles may be won by the better soldier.
*118617*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_in_war_secbrk08_010_kra:40-4750]]
Wars are won by those who are willing to sacrifice everything to ensure victory.
*118618*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_moms_war_resume01_010_son:60-620]]
So…
*118619*
[[S:::1390-3000]]
what were you telling me about mom’s war?
*118620*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_moms_war_resume02_010_son:20-630]]
So…
*118621*
[[S:::1180-3750]]
Brok and Sindri made Mom the axe just to help her survive?
*118622*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_moms_war_resume03_010_son:0-430]]
So…
*118623*
[[S:::1110-2690]]
what were you telling me about mom’s war?
*118624*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_moms_war_secbrk00_010_son:210-910]]
Sindri said…
*118625*
[[S:::1500-2650]]
mother was a warrior.
*118626*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_moms_war_secbrk01_010_son:40-1000]]
Was she in a war too?
*118627*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_moms_war_secbrk02_010_kra:0-750]]
Of a sort.
*118628*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_moms_war_secbrk03_010_kra:0-4000]]
Her family was decimated by hostile rivals, and she alone survived.
*118629*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_moms_war_secbrk04_010_kra:0-1550]]
She walked the warrior’s path,
*118630*
[[S:::1980-3550]]
but her war was to live on.
*118631*
[[S:::4250-6500]]
To brave an unforgiving world alone.
*118632*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_moms_war_secbrk05_010_son:40-2430]]
And that’s why she asked Sindri and Brok to make her the Axe?
*118633*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_moms_war_secbrk06_010_kra:0-4250]]
She had the strength to wield such a weapon, and the wisdom to use it for good.
*118634*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_moms_war_secbrk07_010_kra:0-2250]]
She found purpose in protecting the weak.
*118635*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_moms_war_secbrk08_010_son:0-560]]
So…
*118636*
[[S:::1070-2000]]
she’d help out the Elves?
*118637*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_moms_war_secbrk09_020_kra:30-300]]
No.
*118638*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_ocean_resume01_010_son:30-560]]
So…
*118639*
[[S:::1890-4150]]
what happened to the sailors who drank too much seawater?
*118640*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_ocean_resume02_010_son:250-940]]
So…
*118641*
[[S:::1490-3250]]
the sailors who heard voices at sea…
*118642*
[[S:::4220-5000]]
how did you fix them?
*118643*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_ocean_secbrk00_010_son:0-560]]
Father?
*118644*
[[S:::1370-3000]]
You ever know anyone else who heard voices?
*118645*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_ocean_secbrk01_010_kra:0-2000]]
I knew desperate men at sea who,
*118646*
[[S:::2440-6720]]
when our supplies ran dry, would quench their thirst by drinking seawater.
*118647*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_ocean_secbrk02_010_kra:0-1660]]
They swore the sirens—
*118648*
[[S:::2070-7500]]
evil creatures singing to them from nearby islands—were in fact their wives and daughters,
*118649*
[[S:::7500-8270]]
calling them home.
*118650*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_ocean_secbrk03_010_kra:40-3250]]
They endangered the crew, steering us toward the reefs.
*118651*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_ocean_secbrk04_010_son:230-570]]
Um…
*118652*
[[S:::1100-2000]]
How did you fix them?
*118653*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_ocean_secbrk05_010_kra:40-1380]]
We threw them overboard.
*118654*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_ocean_secbrk06_010_son:40-868]]
Oh.
*118655*
[[S:::2130-5228]]
Well, good thing I didn’t drink any seawater,
*118656*
[[S:::6447-6900]]
right…?
*118657*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_ocean_secbrk06_020_kra:12-939]]
Yes it is.

Hm.
*118660*
[[S:::1510-2171]]
A short one.
*118661*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_intro_030_son:9-1104]]

One more.

Very well…

However…
*118669*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_intro_090_son:0-2250]]

what other stories have you got?
*118673*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_intro_120_kra:16-349]]
Hmm…
*118674*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_interrupt_010_kra:50-410]]
Enough.
*118675*
[[S:::1310-2420]]
Stories are for the boat—
*118676*
[[S:::3110-4000]]
we must focus.
*118677*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_interrupt_020_son:28-583]]
Yes
*118678*
[[S:::583-652]]
sir…
*118679*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_interrupt_030_kra:0-610]]
Hold…
*118680*
[[S:::1400-2500]]
we will finish that later.
*118681*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_interrupt_040_son:7-436]]
Okay!
*118682*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_interrupt_050_kra:50-1500]]
We will continue another time.
*118683*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_interrupt_060_son:9-379]]
Good.
*118684*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_interrupt_070_kra:0-1250]]
But set that aside.
*118685*
[[S:::1620-2890]]
We must proceed on foot.
*118686*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_interrupt_080_son:20-1000]]
Can we finish later?
*118687*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_interrupt_090_kra:0-500]]
Perhaps.
*118688*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_aborts_010_kra:90-1500]]
This is not important right now.
*118689*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_aborts_020_son:50-1000]]
Can we finish later?
*118690*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_aborts_030_kra:46-499]]
No.
*118691*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_aborts_040_kra:0-1270]]
No more time for that.
*118692*
[[S:::1730-2250]]
We must go.
*118693*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_aborts_050_son:0-650]]
Aw…!
*118694*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_aborts_060_kra:120-1560]]
But there is no time for this.
*118695*
[[S:::2060-2540]]
Come.
*118696*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_aborts_070_son:50-1250]]
I guess I got the idea…
*118697*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_aborts_080_kra:0-950]]
But enough of this.
*118698*
[[S:::1400-2000]]
Make ready…
*118699*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_aborts_090_son:0-1250]]
So much for story-time…
*118700*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_aborts_100_kra:70-1250]]
But that is enough of that.
*118701*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_aborts_110_son:10-731]]
We weren’t done!
*118702*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_aborts_120_kra:50-1750]]
We did not come here to sit in a boat.
*118703*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_horse_010_kra:70-1920]]
There was… a horse.
*118704*
[[S:::2470-4630]]
The horse sought vengeance upon his enemy,
*118705*
[[S:::5050-5500]]
a stag.
*118706*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_horse_020_kra:70-1750]]
But he could not kill the stag alone.
*118707*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_horse_030_kra:0-3000]]
The horse met a man, a hunter, and made a deal.
*118708*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_horse_resume01_010_son:220-800]]
So
*118709*
[[S:::1320-3250]]
what happened when the horse made a deal with the hunter?
*118710*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_horse_resume01_010_son_a:15-2887]]
So what happened when the horse made a deal with the hunter?
*118711*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_horse_secbrk01_010_kra:0-4250]]
He took the man’s bit and bridle, and allowed him to ride in a saddle on his back.
*118712*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_horse_secbrk01_020_kra:0-2130]]
Together, they killed the stag,
*118713*
[[S:::2660-4220]]
and the horse tasted victory.
*118714*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_horse_secbrk01_030_kra:40-2260]]
But the hunter would not release the horse,
*118715*
[[S:::2750-4250]]
and made a slave of him.
*118716*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_horse_secbrk01_040_son:51-2318]]
So getting revenge cost him his freedom.
*118717*
[[S:::3942-4749]]
Hope it was worth it.
*118718*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_horse_secbrk01_050_kra:50-750]]
It was not.
*118719*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_frog_010_kra:0-1500]]
There was a tale of a frog.
*118720*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_frog_020_kra:0-1260]]
His pond had dried up,
*118721*
[[S:::1660-4500]]
so the frog and his son left to find a new home.
*118722*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_frog_030_kra:0-750]]
They found a well.
*118723*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_frog_040_kra:0-2150]]
The son saw the water and made to jump in,
*118724*
[[S:::2750-3750]]
but the father stopped him.
*118725*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_frog_resume01_010_son:40-2250]]
So what happened when the frog found the well?
*118726*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_frog_resume02_010_son:30-2750]]
So the frog and his son… just walked away from the well?
*118727*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_frog_secbrk01_010_kra:70-5841]]
He saw the well was deep, and once inside they would not be able escape if the water dried up again. 
*118728*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_frog_secbrk01_020_kra:0-1750]]
Wisely, they moved on.
*118729*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_frog_secbrk01_030_son:6-448]]
That’s it?
*118731*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_frog_secbrk01_040_kra:18-509]]
Yes.
*118732*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_frog_secbrk01_050_son:100-1260]]
That’s really not a story.
*118733*
[[S:::2280-4500]]
If the son jumped in, it would be a story.
*118734*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_frog_secbrk01_050_son_a:100-1400]]
That’s really not a story.
*118735*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_frog_secbrk01_060_kra:0-3750]]
Then he would be trapped, and starve while the father watched helplessly.
*118736*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_frog_secbrk01_050_son_b:0-2350]]
If the son jumped in, it would be a story.
*118737*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_frog_secbrk01_070_son:0-410]]
See?
*118738*
[[S:::970-1750]]
That’s a story.
*118739*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_thief_010_kra:160-3500]]
There was a young man who was caught stealing and condemned to die.
*118740*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_thief_020_kra:33-1912]]
His mother came to visit his prison.
*118741*
[[S:::2518-3704]]
She was a kind woman,
*118742*
[[S:::4171-5289]]
who could only give love.
*118743*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_thief_030_kra:0-1250]]
But her son, the thief,
*118744*
[[S:::1800-4000]]
met her with rage, and bit off her ear.
*118745*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_thief_040_son:0-554]]
What!
*118746*
[[S:::1050-1660]]
Why?
*118747*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_thief_resume01_010_son:0-2250]]
So why did the thief bite his mom’s ear?
*118748*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_thief_secbrk01_010_kra:0-2250]]
Because the boy had always been a thief.
*118749*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_thief_secbrk01_020_kra:0-3500]]
And his mother had taught him only love, and nothing of consequences.
*118750*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_thief_secbrk01_030_kra:0-2000]]
Had he been taught discipline instead,
*118751*
[[S:::2430-3750]]
he might have lived longer.
*118752*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_thief_secbrk01_040_son:70-880]]
Sure, but…
*118753*
[[S:::1730-2630]]
her ear…
*118754*
[[S:::3330-4000]]
that’s not right…
*118755*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_crab_010_kra:0-3500]]
There was the story of the mother crab, who scolded her son. 
*118756*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_crab_020_kra:0-2690]]
She told him he should walk forward, in pride—
*118757*
[[S:::3080-5000]]
not sideways as he always did.
*118758*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_crab_030_son:10-1235]]
But she’s a crab too!
*118759*
[[S:::1804-5726]]
He should say, “sure, I’ll walk forward as soon as you show me how!”
*118760*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_crab_030_son_a:19-1170]]
But she’s a crab too!
*118761*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_crab_030_son_b:16-3895]]
He should say, “sure, I’ll walk forward as soon as you show me how!”
*118762*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_crab_040_kra:0-570]]
Yes.
*118763*
[[S:::1150-2500]]
He did say that.
*118764*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_crab_050_kra:33-1598]]
That was the story.
*118765*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_crab_060_son:130-690]]
I got it.
*118766*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_crab_resume01_010_son:40-1250]]
Know what that crab should have told his mother?
*118767*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_trees_010_kra:20-1630]]
There is a tale about a woodsman.
*118768*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_trees_020_kra:0-3750]]
He asked the trees of the forest for a branch to make a handle for his axe.
*118769*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_trees_030_kra:50-840]]
Instead,
*118770*
[[S:::1230-4500]]
the trees gave him a young sapling, so they could keep their limbs.
*118771*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_trees_040_kra:0-1410]]
The woodsman made his axe.
*118772*
[[S:::1840-2800]]
And then he returned,
*118773*
[[S:::3200-5750]]
and chopped down the oldest trees in the forest.
*118774*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_aesop_trees_050_son:28-3297]]
Hm… just cause trees are old doesn’t mean they’re smart…
*118775*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_1st_interrupt_020_mmr:0-1500]]
Completely understand.
*118776*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_1st_interrupt_030_mmr:15-1264]]
I’ll finish later, lad.
*118777*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_mimirglobal_020_kra:160-2550]]
Enough. No stories—not while on foot.
*118778*
[[S:::3000-4000]]
Our focus is the road.
*118779*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_mimirglobal_interrupt02_3_080_son:20-420]]
Okay….
*118780*
[[S:::2100-3000]]
What’s a bookmark?
*118781*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_mimirglobal_interrupt02_3_100_son:0-550]]
Okay…
*118782*
[[S:::1860-2380]]
I don’t think
*118783*
[[S:::2990-3250]]
we have any pins.
*118784*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_mimirglobal_interrupt04_5_020_son:3-2436]]
Aw, and it was getting good.
*118785*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_mimirglobal_interrupt04_5_050_son:27-1065]]
Aww…
*118786*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_mimirglobal_interrupt04_5_080_son:9-2359]]
Aawww… and it was almost over.
*118787*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_mimirglobal_resume01_010_son:100-790]]
Hey, Mimir.
*118788*
[[S:::1510-2630]]
Last we were in a boat,
*118789*
[[S:::3070-4250]]
you had just started a story…
*118790*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_mimirglobal_resume01_030_son:0-520]]
Mimir,
*118791*
[[S:::1160-3000]]
can you start that story again—from before?
*118792*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_mimirglobal_resume02_3_010_son:0-530]]
Mimir,
*118793*
[[S:::1490-2830]]
you were in the middle of a story before.
*118794*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_mimirglobal_resume02_3_050_son:0-500]]
Mimir,
*118795*
[[S:::1370-2750]]
can you finish that story you started?
*118796*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec1_interrupt_010_mmr:0-2750]]
Oop—didn’t get far did we? It’ll keep.
*118797*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec1_interrupt_020_mmr:9-1847]]
Ah… We’ll just start that one again later, yeah?
*118798*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec1_interrupt_030_mmr:0-1750]]
Or I can just tell you this story later!
*118799*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec1_interrupt_040_mmr:0-1210]]
I can start again later.
*118800*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec1_interrupt_050_mmr:0-420]]
Know what?
*118801*
[[S:::1050-2200]]
I’ll tell this one later.
*118802*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec1_interrupt_060_mmr:13-1311]]
And we’ll pick this up later.
*118803*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec1_resume_020_mmr:0-490]]
Right then.
*118804*
[[S:::860-2750]]
I’d just started a story earlier…
*118805*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec1_resume_040_mmr:10-2459]]
Now then… that story I started earlier.
*118806*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec1_resume_050_mmr:0-3750]]
So… if you remember, I’d started a doozy of a story earlier.
*118807*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec2_3_interrupt_010_mmr:2-1375]]
And we’ll just stop there for now.
*118808*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec2_3_interrupt_020_mmr:9-985]]
We’ll finish this later.
*118809*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec2_3_interrupt_030_mmr:0-2750]]
Aaannd time to walk. The story will keep.
*118810*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec2_3_interrupt_040_mmr:9-1669]]
We’ll just pick this up at a later time.
*118811*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec2_3_interrupt_050_mmr:0-1250]]
That’s enough for the time being.
*118812*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec2_3_interrupt_060_mmr:7-1512]]
Let’s pick this up later then.
*118813*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec2_3_interrupt_070_mmr:0-880]]
Let’s bookmark that.
*118814*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec2_3_interrupt_090_mmr:0-1430]]
And time to put a pin in it.
*118815*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec2_3_interrupt_110_mmr:4-987]]
He’s not kidding, is he?
*118816*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec2_3_resume_020_mmr:0-560]]
Was I?
*118817*
[[S:::930-1500]]
Oh, yes!
*118818*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec2_3_resume_030_mmr:0-2170]]
Right then. Where were we? Ah, yes
*118819*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec2_3_resume_040_mmr:0-2500]]
Right then. We were in the middle of a story, weren’t we?
*118820*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec2_3_resume_060_mmr:0-2520]]
I can indeed. Where were we? Oh!
*118821*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec2_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-1500]]
But we will have to conclude this… later!
*118822*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec4_5_interrupt_030_mmr:0-1310]]
And on that dramatic note,
*118823*
[[S:::1730-4250]]
we must delay the conclusion of our exciting tale.
*118824*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec4_5_interrupt_040_mmr:7-2607]]
But the conclusion of this thrilling tale will have to wait.
*118825*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec4_5_interrupt_060_mmr:0-1760]]
This dock can only mean one thing!
*118826*
[[S:::2280-3750]]
We are taking a break from this story.
*118827*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_sec4_5_interrupt_070_mmr:0-1750]]
But we will have to wait for the conclusion.
*118828*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_sec4_5_resume_010_son:80-510]]
Mimir,
*118829*
[[S:::920-2250]]
can you finish that story real quick?
*118830*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_sec4_5_resume_020_son:30-3363]]
Mimir, I know we were almost done with that story…
*118831*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_sec4_5_resume_030_mmr:7-644]]
Oh yes…
*118832*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_sec4_5_resume_040_mmr:40-1750]]
Alright, what say we finish that story?
*118833*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_sec4_5_resume_050_son:60-1320]]
Before anything else happens—
*118834*
[[S:::2620-2850]]
how’s that story end?
*118835*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_sec4_5_resume_060_mmr:0-2500]]
I believe our story was in need of a conclusion.
*118836*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_sec4_5_resume_070_mmr:0-2250]]
Just time enough for the finale of our prior tale.
*118837*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thamur_010_mmr:1650-4250]]
It’s time I told you of the Giant Thamur.
*118838*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thamur_020_mmr:0-5266]]
He was a very giant Giant—who, despite his mountainous size,
*118839*
[[S:::5600-9921]]
was without question the greatest stonemason this world had ever seen.
*118840*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thamur_030_mmr:0-4270]]
Proud Thamur hoped to one day pass his vast knowledge on to his son,
*118841*
[[S:::4760-7250]]
but young Hrimthur had the heart of a warrior
*118842*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thamur_040_mmr:0-1650]]
Perhaps the father had too much fear in him,
*118843*
[[S:::2160-3200]]
or the son too little… 
*118844*
[[S:::3750-8630]]
either way, a quarrel of theirs spiralled out of control, and the overworked stonemason—bonk!—
*118845*
[[S:::9020-9750]]
struck his son.
*118846*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thamur_050_mmr:0-2000]]
Hrimthur ran off into the night.
*118847*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thamur_060_mmr:0-1680]]
Feeling shame and regret,
*118848*
[[S:::2140-3780]]
Thamur chased after his son,
*118849*
[[S:::4280-9000]]
but in his emotional state, soon found himself wandering Midgard, lost and alone.
*118850*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thamur_070_mmr:0-5567]]
Sadly, he caught the eye of the one person he didn’t want to meet alone at night, so far from home…
*118851*
[[S:::6537-7322]]
Thor.
*118852*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thamur_090_mmr:5-877]]
You’ll see.
*118853*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thamur_sec1_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-1750]]
Regarding the Giant called Thamur…
*118854*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thamur_sec2_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-4500]]
It was about the very giant Giant, Thamur the great stonemason.
*118855*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thamur_sec3_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-3150]]
Thamur wished to train his son Hrimthur as a stonemason,
*118856*
[[S:::3610-5250]]
but the boy yearned for battle
*118857*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thamur_sec4_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-4460]]
Thamur, the giant stonemason, struck his warlike son in the heat of a quarrel.
*118858*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thamur_sec5_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-4250]]
Thamur, the giant stonemason, struck his warlike son in the heat of a quarrel,
*118859*
[[S:::4680-6250]]
and the boy ran off into the night.
*118860*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thamur_sec6_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-3820]]
Thamur, the giant stonemason, distraught after striking his son,
*118861*
[[S:::4180-6500]]
become lost in Midgard looking for the boy.
*118862*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_thamur_secbrk06_020_son:30-800]]
And?!?
*118863*
[[S:::930-1810]]
What happened next?
*118864*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_020_mmr:0-1120]]
I beg your pardon!
*118865*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_040_mmr:0-880]]
Yeah, I got that.
*118866*
[[S:::1530-3150]]
So you want a corker, do ya?
*118867*
[[S:::3750-5050]]
Very well, my brothers—
*118868*
[[S:::5570-8300]]
I’ll tell you the story of Hrungnir the Brawler.
*118869*
[[S:::8700-10250]]
The real story.
*118870*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_060_mmr:0-2454]]
A pretty story, but… no.
*118871*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_070_mmr:100-3530]]
Hrungnir, you see, was born with neither head nor heart,
*118872*
[[S:::3890-6000]]
so the Giants had to complete him with stone.
*118873*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_080_mmr:0-1810]]
He was strong, to be sure—
*118874*
[[S:::2360-4000]]
but also a perfect simpleton.
*118875*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_090_mmr:0-2210]]
Odin met him wandering in Midgard one day—
*118876*
[[S:::2700-5540]]
found him so amusing, so harmless, so gullible,
*118877*
[[S:::5940-8250]]
that he invites him back to his palace in Asgard.
*118878*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_100_mmr:0-2340]]
There he gives Hrungnir his fill of mead,
*118879*
[[S:::2810-7750]]
and goads him into all manner of boasts and antics, all for the amusement of the court.
*118880*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_110_mmr:0-760]]
I was there—
*118881*
[[S:::1250-5530]]
I saw the the Aesir laugh as Hrungnir leapt upon his shield and swore
*118882*
[[S:::5530-8350]]
he’d kill us all and take our womenfolk back to Jötunheim.
*118883*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_120_mmr:0-1760]]
Then Thor shows up—
*118884*
[[S:::2330-3250]]
and does he laugh.
*118885*
[[S:::3650-4610]]
Oh, no.
*118886*
[[S:::5180-7806]]
Thor takes one look at the drunken stone buffoon,
*118887*
[[S:::8141-14000]]
and brings down Mjölnir on his head so hard that he’s got chunks of Hrungnir in his own skull to this day.
*118888*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_130_mmr:0-2410]]
Thor is so startled by the faceful of rock,
*118889*
[[S:::2930-7750]]
he doesn’t notice Hrungnir’s body topple right onto him with a sickening crunch!
*118890*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_120_mmr_a:0-1900]]
Then Thor shows up—
*118891*
[[S:::2330-3350]]
and does he laugh?
*118892*
[[S:::3650-4600]]
Oh, no.
*118893*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_120_mmr_b:180-6250]]
Thor takes one look at the drunken stone buffoon, and brings down Mjölnir on his head so hard that
*118894*
[[S:::6250-9300]]
he’s got chunks of Hrungnir in his own skull to this day.
*118895*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_140_mmr:0-660]]
And again,
*118896*
[[S:::1340-4750]]
the roars of laughter echo through the palace halls!
*118897*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_160_mmr:0-1560]]
Let that be a lesson, m’son—
*118898*
[[S:::2280-4750]]
truth is seldom so pretty as myth and legend.
*118899*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_sec1_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-2450]]
I was to tell you the story of Hrungnir the Brawler—
*118900*
[[S:::2870-4000]]
the real story.
*118901*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_sec2_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-4500]]
The real story of Hrungnir the Brawler, a giant with head and heart of stone.
*118902*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_sec3_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-5250]]
Hrungnir, the simple-minded stone giant, was invited by Odin to his palace in Asgard.
*118903*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_sec4_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-5750]]
Odin had invited Hrungnir to his palace in Asgard, getting the simple giant drunk to amuse the court.
*118904*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_sec5_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-7200]]
Thor arrives at the palace in Asgard to find Hrungnir, the simple stone-giant, carousing on Odin’s mead.
*118905*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_sec6_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-3730]]
Hrungnir’s stone head is smashed to pieces by Thor’s hammer.
*118906*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_sec7_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-5500]]
Thor smashes the stone head of Hrungnir, who falls upon him with a sickening crunch.
*118907*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_secbrk00_010_kra:130-2610]]
Head… you are full of stories.
*118908*
[[S:::3200-5720]]
When will you tell one that entertains?
*118909*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_secbrk00_030_son:27-1343]]
He just insulted you.
*118910*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_secbrk01_010_son:70-4610]]
There was a huge battle, right? His shrine had him in the middle, fighting off Aesir…
*118911*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_hrungnir_secbrk07_020_son:15-4165]]
That’s an awful story, Mimir. Nothing like the ones mother told me.
*118912*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_020_mmr:0-1900]]
She was called Skaði,
*118913*
[[S:::2340-3500]]
Queen of the Hunt.
*118914*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_040_mmr:0-2986]]
From the ribs of pack-beasts she fashioned second feet allowing
*118915*
[[S:::3342-7080]]
her to glide upon the snow so no animal could evade her.
*118916*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_050_mmr:0-3250]]
She became a huntress beyond compare, even to any god.
*118917*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_060_mmr:30-5000]]
Odin himself wanted her for his bride, believing she would bear him strong sons.
*118918*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_070_mmr:0-1680]]
But she spurned his affections…
*118919*
[[S:::2180-3440]]
and for that insult,
*118920*
[[S:::3890-5788]]
Odin vowed revenge.
*118921*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_080_mmr:0-6450]]
It was put forth that the Aesir were plagued by an Eagle who would steal the precious golden apples of Iðunn.
*118922*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_090_mmr:0-3004]]
Not even the finest archer among the gods could bring it down
*118923*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_100_mmr:0-4855]]
Odin knew that Skaði could not resist the temptation to prove herself superior.
*118924*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_101_mmr:20-1250]]
And so she joined the hunt.
*118925*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_110_mmr:0-3664]]
Skaði tracked the Eagle as it flew where she alone could glide,
*118926*
[[S:::4068-6428]]
and loosed an arrow from her unerring bow.
*118927*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_120_mmr:0-1290]]
When she collected her quarry,
*118928*
[[S:::1960-3250]]
she found no Eagle at all,
*118929*
[[S:::4090-8816]]
but her own father, poor Thiazi, slain by his own daughter.
*118930*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_130_mmr:0-1892]]
She was overcome with grief and shame,
*118931*
[[S:::2486-6750]]
for there is nothing nature so reviles as a child who kills their parent.
*118932*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_140_mmr:0-3540]]
Skaði succumbed to her fate as Winter’s blanket fell—
*118933*
[[S:::4110-6650]]
holding her father as the mountain held her,
*118934*
[[S:::7190-9250]]
in an embrace to last eternity.
*118935*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_160_mmr:0-560]]
Aye.
*118936*
[[S:::1270-3500]]
There aren’t many happy endings for the Giants, I’m afraid.
*118937*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_sec1_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-2500]]
It was about Skaði, Queen of the Hunt.
*118938*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_sec2_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-4750]]
If you recall, Skaði, the Queen of the Hunt, was being courted by Odin himself.
*118939*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_sec3_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-3890]]
It was about the Queen of the Hunt, who rejected Odin’s romantic advances,
*118940*
[[S:::4320-6205]]
causing him to vow revenge.
*118941*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_sec4_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-5750]]
Seeking revenge on Skaði the Huntress, Odin spread rumours the Aesir were plagued by an Eagle.
*118942*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_sec5_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-4410]]
Skaði, Queen of the Hunt, had been lured by Odin into hunting an Eagle.
*118943*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_sec6_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-1867]]
We were near the end of Skaði’s tale,
*118944*
[[S:::2226-6767]]
as the Queen of the Hunt discovered that Odin had tricked her into slaying her own father.
*118945*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_secbrk00_010_son:0-700]]
Mimir,
*118946*
[[S:::1200-3372]]
what can you tell me about that Giant lady with the bow?
*118947*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_secbrk01_010_mmr:0-4095]]
Her father was Thiazi, who could take the shape of any wild creature,
*118948*
[[S:::4526-6724]]
and taught Skaði how to hunt them all.
*118949*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_skadi_secbrk06_020_son:0-1350]]
Well, that was sad.
*118950*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_ymir_020_mmr:0-4814]]
In the beginning, there was Ginnungagap, the great void.
*118951*
[[S:::5145-8499]]
There were no realms yet, only primordial forces.
*118952*
[[S:::8680-13250]]
There was Fire, and there was Ice, and there in the Void they met, and produced…
*118953*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_ymir_040_mmr:0-5072]]
More than water—the mystic life blood of something entirely new.
*118954*
[[S:::5640-11424]]
From this water, Ymir took form, and became a being of pure creation and chaos,
*118955*
[[S:::11500-13893]]
mother and father to all that came after.
*118956*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_ymir_060_mmr:0-600]]
Aye,
*118957*
[[S:::1000-4500]]
every god, man, and beast came first from Ymir’s flesh.
*118958*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_ymir_070_mmr:0-3545]]
Though it was the Aesir who thought themselves so superior
*118959*
[[S:::3786-6460]]
that they should hold dominion over the rest of creation.
*118960*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_ymir_080_mmr:0-2890]]
It was Odin who took arms against his creator,
*118961*
[[S:::3250-6000]]
and spilled Ymir’s life-blood with his spear.
*118962*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_ymir_090_mmr:0-3500]]
A necessary evil, he would say, to bring Order to the realms
*118963*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_ymir_100_mmr:0-1960]]
From Ymir’s torn flesh,
*118964*
[[S:::2320-5500]]
Odin would fashion the realm of Midgard for his own.
*118965*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_ymir_110_mmr:0-5250]]
Called himself “Allfather”—as if he was the creator, and not the creator’s destroyer.
*118966*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_ymir_140_mmr:10-2793]]
Mm? Oh, sorry, m’boy.
*118967*
[[S:::4015-6851]]
You know, I think it best we just end it there actually.
*118968*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_ymir_sec1_cus_resume_010_mmr:50-4500]]
If I recall, we had begun to discuss the origin of Ymir, the first Giant.
*118969*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_ymir_sec2_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-970]]
Regarding Ymir—
*118970*
[[S:::1400-5750]]
primordial fire and ice met in the great void, producing water.
*118971*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_ymir_sec3_cus_resume_010_mmr:50-2948]]
Ymir the First Giant had emerged from the void,
*118972*
[[S:::3141-6599]]
and every form of life began to spring forth from Ymir.
*118973*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_ymir_sec4_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-4250]]
Into the legend of Ymir, the first Giant, enter the Aesir gods.
*118974*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_ymir_sec5_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-4036]]
Odin’s spear had spilled the life-blood of Ymir, the First Giant.
*118975*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_ymir_sec6_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-5750]]
Odin had slain Ymir, and used the primeval Giant’s flesh to shape the realm of Midgard
*118976*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_ymir_secbrk00_010_son:190-930]]
I have a question.
*118977*
[[S:::1770-3230]]
If Ymir was the First Giant,
*118978*
[[S:::3740-4670]]
where did he come from?
*118979*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_ymir_secbrk02_010_son:40-640]]
Water?
*118980*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_ymir_secbrk03_010_son:34-1066]]
Even the Aesir?
*118981*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_ymir_secbrk06_020_mmr:0-995]]
A small…
*118982*
[[S:::1295-1921]]
covetous…
*118983*
[[S:::2221-2770]]
tyrant…
*118984*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_ymir_secbrk06_030_son:36-804]]
Mimir…?
*118985*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_bergelmir_secbrk01_010_son:120-940]]
Oh yeah…
*118986*
[[S:::1410-2430]]
I remember his shrine.
*118987*
[[S:::2880-4430]]
It looked happier than the other ones…
*118988*
[[S:::4940-5500]]
mostly.
*118989*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_bergelmir_secbrk01_010_son_a:60-800]]
Oh yeah…
*118990*
[[S:::1380-2360]]
I remember his shrine.
*118991*
[[S:::2860-4430]]
It looked happier than the other ones…
*118992*
[[S:::4920-5500]]
mostly.
*118993*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_bergelmir_secbrk02_010_kra:20-2500]]
Finally. A story worth hearing.
*118994*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_bergelmir_secbrk09_020_son:160-1370]]
“Bergelmir the Beloved”…
*118995*
[[S:::2590-3040]]
hunh…
*118996*
[[S:::4150-5700]]
I’ve never heard a story end that way.
*118997*
[[S:::6610-7750]]
Not a true one, anyway.
*118998*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_010_mmr:11-4520]]
If I’m not mistaken, we’ve yet to discuss the tale of the giant Bergelmir…
*118999*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_030_mmr:0-2861]]
… it begins in an ocean of blood!
*119000*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_050_mmr:0-770]]
If you remember,
*119001*
[[S:::1210-4750]]
Ymir, the first Giant, was fatally stabbed by Odin.
*119002*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_060_mmr:0-2644]]
It’s in his blood our story starts.
*119003*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_070_mmr:0-6180]]
Ymir’s magical guts poured out in a torrent so violent it threatened to flood all of creation.
*119004*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_080_mmr:0-4650]]
The Jötnar were unprepared, as the very last of them were washed away in the endless tide.
*119005*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_090_mmr:0-4250]]
Not just Ymir, but all of Giant-kind faced extinction.
*119006*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_100_mmr:0-2500]]
And so would Odin’s victory have been complete.
*119007*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_110_mmr:0-700]]
But...
*119008*
[[S:::870-3886]]
Ymir’s kind did not all perish that day.
*119009*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_120_mmr:0-2375]]
Staying afloat in the hollowed husk of a tree,
*119010*
[[S:::2662-6400]]
the Frost Giant Bergelmir endured, as did his lady wife.
*119011*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_130_mmr:0-4000]]
For weeks they sailed, until finally they came upon a new land.
*119012*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_140_mmr:0-2120]]
They called it Jötunheim,
*119013*
[[S:::2800-4918]]
and there they would start anew.
*119014*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_150_mmr:0-4115]]
As father and mother they would multiply exceedingly, and as King and Queen
*119015*
[[S:::4381-9500]]
they worked to make Jötunheim a land where Giants would know no master but themselves.
*119016*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_160_mmr:0-2860]]
Bergelmir never sought revenge for Odin’s slaughter. 
*119017*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_170_mmr:0-2748]]
His vengeance was to live, and prosper.
*119018*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_180_mmr:0-973]]
He died at peace,
*119019*
[[S:::1508-3345]]
a legion of his kin to mourn him.
*119020*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_190_mmr:0-3230]]
He would ever be known as Bergelmir the Beloved.
*119021*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_210_mmr:0-900]]
Few do, laddy.
*119022*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_sec1_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-2507]]
We were just starting the tale of the giant Bergelmir…
*119023*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_sec2_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-2980]]
The tale of Bergelmir begins in an ocean of blood!
*119024*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_sec3_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-3500]]
We return to Odin’s mortal wounding of the giant Ymir.
*119025*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_sec4_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-1570]]
Odin slew Ymir,
*119026*
[[S:::1990-5500]]
and the torrent of blood threatened to flood all of creation.
*119027*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_sec5_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-3250]]
The torrent of Ymir’s blood had washed away the Jötnar.
*119028*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_sec6_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-4750]]
Ymir’s blood had washed away the Jötnar, but not every Giant was lost.
*119029*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_sec7_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-5000]]
I was telling you of Bergelmir and his wife, lost upon an endless ocean of blood.
*119030*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_sec8_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-3750]]
We had come to Bergelmir and his Queen, and the founding of a new realm.
*119031*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_berglemir_sec9_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-3940]]
We need only conclude the song of Bergelmir, founder of Jötunheim,
*119032*
[[S:::4340-6250]]
who chose love instead of revenge.
*119033*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_groa_020_mmr:0-2750]]
Ah, that would be Gróa, the Knowledge Keeper.
*119034*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_groa_030_mmr:0-5720]]
She was a gifted sorceress who gathered every tome of arcane wisdom she could find in the realms,
*119035*
[[S:::6190-8910]]
all in the hopes of augmenting her powers of prophecy
*119036*
[[S:::9167-11707]]
that she might find her lost husband, Aurvandil.
*119037*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_groa_040_mmr:67-3631]]
But it was not her husband she would glimpse in her visions—
*119038*
[[S:::4130-11270]]
for it was Gróa, seeing longer and farther than any before or since, who witnessed Ragnarök—
*119039*
[[S:::11810-13484]]
the end and the beginning.
*119040*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_groa_050_mmr:0-2690]]
When Odin caught word of her ultimate prophecy,
*119041*
[[S:::3160-6625]]
he manoeuvred to obtain her knowledge and hoard it for himself.
*119042*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_groa_060_mmr:0-3262]]
Gróa knew Odin as a longtime patron of her services,
*119043*
[[S:::3518-6224]]
and so she welcomed him into her library as a friend.
*119044*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_groa_070_mmr:0-1120]]
What she did not know
*119045*
[[S:::1550-5350]]
is that Odin himself was behind her husband’s disappearance,
*119046*
[[S:::5780-10500]]
having used his enchantments to conceal his death at Thor’s hands from her sight.
*119047*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_groa_080_mmr:0-3270]]
Smiling, jealous Odin took her by the throat,
*119048*
[[S:::3740-6720]]
and with his very hands he stole her library
*119049*
[[S:::7180-8750]]
and her life for his own.
*119050*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_groa_100_mmr:0-2330]]
Ruthless? Barbaric? Heartless?
*119051*
[[S:::2810-3710]]
That’s Odin.
*119052*
[[S:::4280-7896]]
In fact, we would do well to sit here in silence for the next few moments
*119053*
[[S:::8145-10883]]
and reflect on Odin’s capacity for cruelty.
*119054*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_groa_110_mmr:12-725]]
And so—
*119055*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_groa_sec1_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-2190]]
Concerning Gróa, the Knowledge Keeper…
*119056*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_groa_sec2_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-3496]]
Gróa the sorceress assembled a library of arcane knowledge,
*119057*
[[S:::3756-7307]]
hoping to increase her prophetic powers to find her lost husband.
*119058*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_groa_sec3_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-3260]]
Gróa, the Knowledge Keeper, sought out her husband in visions,
*119059*
[[S:::3610-6000]]
but instead discovered Ragnarök.
*119060*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_groa_sec4_cus_resume_010_mmr:0-4750]]
Odin schemed to capture the visions of Ragnarök recorded by Gróa, the Knowledge Keeper.
*119061*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_groa_secbrk00_010_son:170-780]]
Mimir—
*119062*
[[S:::1370-5250]]
there was a shrine about a Giant lady, with lots of books, and visions…
*119063*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_groa_secbrk04_020_son:0-1880]]
I always knew Odin was bad.
*119064*
[[S:::2720-3850]]
But that’s just…
*119065*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_groa_secbrk04_050_kra:0-1000]]
Reflect longer.
*119066*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_starkadr_resume01_010_mmr:110-3755]]
It was about the Giant with eight arms—Starkaðr the Mighty.
*119067*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_starkadr_resume02_010_mmr:130-2860]]
Starkaðr, the mighty and many-limbed Giant
*119068*
[[S:::3220-5500]]
whose praises I should have known better than to sing.
*119069*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_starkadr_resume03_010_mmr:220-4500]]
Odin was plotting the downfall of Starkaðr, the mighty eight-armed Giant.
*119070*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_starkadr_resume04_010_mmr:330-5750]]
Odin sought to undo Starkaðr, the mighty eight-armed Giant, but not by direct attack.
*119071*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_starkadr_resume05_010_mmr:100-4500]]
The Aesir gods slandered the noble giant Starkaðr with vile rumours.
*119072*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_starkadr_resume06_010_mmr:360-6000]]
Through Odin’s vile rumours, a mob was raised against Starkaðr, the mighty eight-armed Giant.
*119073*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_starkadr_resume07_010_mmr:40-4500]]
Starkaðr, the mighty eight-armed Giant, had surrendered in hopes to clear his name.
*119074*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_starkadr_resume08_010_mmr:300-4840]]
Starkaðr, the mighty eight-armed Giant, had surrendered in hopes to clear his name…
*119075*
[[S:::5460-8500]]
and Thor responded by tearing him limb from limb.
*119076*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_starkadr_secbrk00_010_son:60-2500]]
Okay—what about the Giant with eight arms?
*119077*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_starkadr_secbrk00_020_mmr:70-2500]]
Starkaðr the Mighty, he was called.
*119078*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_starkadr_secbrk01_010_mmr:90-5640]]
If the Giants ever had anything so organised as an army, Starkaðr would have been their general—
*119079*
[[S:::6190-7640]]
an opinion, in retrospect,
*119080*
[[S:::8050-9250]]
I should have kept to myself.
*119081*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_starkadr_secbrk02_010_mmr:50-670]]
But no,
*119082*
[[S:::1090-3760]]
as Odin’s advisor I kept him advised…
*119083*
[[S:::4240-8250]]
and having bent his will towards Starkaðr’s doom there was no dissuading him.
*119084*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_starkadr_secbrk03_010_mmr:80-3932]]
But even Thor wasn’t stupid enough to take on Starkaðr on his own.
*119085*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_starkadr_secbrk04_010_mmr:30-4680]]
No, instead, the Aesir set forth slanders upon Starkaðr’s name,
*119086*
[[S:::5110-8432]]
branding him throughout the realms as a monster to be feared.
*119087*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_starkadr_secbrk05_010_mmr:70-5407]]
They said he abducted an Elf-queen, who killed herself rather than be ravished by the giant
*119088*
[[S:::5790-9151]]
(lies, of course—but you’re too young for her story).
*119089*
[[S:::9680-15118]]
In the end, even the Vanir gods and armies of Midgard were roused to the cause.
*119090*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_starkadr_secbrk05_010_mmr_b:60-5500]]
In the end, even the Vanir gods and the armies of Midgard were roused to the cause.
*119091*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_starkadr_secbrk06_010_mmr:80-4730]]
They surrounded Starkaðr, showered him with arrows until he was brought to his knees.
*119092*
[[S:::5370-6210]]
He surrendered,
*119093*
[[S:::6560-8500]]
hoping by trial he could clear his name.
*119094*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_starkadr_secbrk05_010_mmr_a:40-5600]]
They said he abducted an Elf-queen, who killed herself rather than be ravished by the Giant
*119095*
[[S:::5700-9200]]
(lies, of course—but you’re too young for her story).
*119096*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_starkadr_secbrk07_010_mmr:90-3470]]
Thor took advantage and ripped off one of Starkaðr’s arms—
*119097*
[[S:::3880-8750]]
which only made it easier to sever another, and another, until he was satisfied.
*119098*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_starkadr_secbrk08_010_mmr:70-2700]]
Relieved of six arms and too much blood,
*119099*
[[S:::3150-5540]]
Starkaðr perished upon the battlefield.
*119100*
[[S:::6724-9367]]
(sighs) I regret it to this day, you know.
*119101*
[[S:::10050-11950]]
I told myself there was nothing I could do.
*119102*
[[S:::12790-13929]]
But I wish I’d tried.
*119103*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_surtr_resume01_010_son:29-1739]]
Wasn’t it… Surtr the Brave?
*119104*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_surtr_resume02_010_mmr:120-3000]]
We were speaking of Surtr the Brave, the fire giant.
*119105*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_surtr_resume03_010_mmr:80-4750]]
It was about Surtr the fire giant, and we were just coming to his flaming sword…
*119106*

Surtr the Brave, who accepts his fate to perish in Ragnarök.

Mimir,
*119109*
[[S:::1570-3670]]
is there a story for the Giant with the flaming sword?
*119110*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_surtr_secbrk00_020_mmr:179-1102]]
Surtr the Brave?
*119111*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_surtr_secbrk01_010_mmr:0-1032]]
Of course!
*119112*
[[S:::1570-8511]]
We’ve spoken so much of frost Giants, it’s about time we instead met the most fiery Giant of all.
*119113*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_surtr_secbrk02_010_mmr_c:60-5370]]
He came from Muspelheim, the fire realm, bringing heat to the young cosmos,
*119114*
[[S:::5380-8200]]
conjuring the Sun from his primordial flame.
*119115*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_surtr_secbrk02_010_mmr:330-5483]]
Back when Ymir first emerged from Ginnungagap, it was Surtr who followed next.
*119116*
[[S:::5864-10925]]
He came from Muspelheim, the fire realm, bringing heat to the young cosmos,
*119117*
[[S:::11141-13994]]
conjuring the Sun from his primordial flame.
*119118*
[[S:::14530-16810]]
But let’s come to that flaming sword, shall we?
*119119*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_surtr_secbrk02_010_mmr_a:330-5615]]

*119125*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_surtr_secbrk03_010_mmr:740-4870]]
Surtr the Brave forged his sword of flame for one purpose alone—
*119126*
[[S:::5410-8500]]
to burn down Asgard when Ragnarök comes at last.
*119127*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_surtr_secbrk04_010_mmr:330-4160]]
His destiny is to fall at the hands of Thor and Odin,
*119128*
[[S:::4600-9650]]
but in so doing, strike the blow that leaves their realm in ash and ruin.
*119129*
[[S:::10240-11460]]
And from that destruction,
*119130*
[[S:::11850-14070]]
the world can be born anew.
*119131*
[[S:::14920-15790]]
Until then,
*119132*
[[S:::16190-22120]]
alone he waits in Muspelheim, never sleeping, ever honing his fiery blade.
*119133*
[[S:::22750-24760]]
Brave, generous Surtr,
*119134*
[[S:::25210-27443]]

To truly embrace your purpose, and the patience and sacrifice it demands,

is to ensure your day will come.
*119137*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_surtr_secbrk05_010_mmr:120-5590]]
All because he chooses to serve a grand cycle, so much bigger than himself.

Do you think we’ll be there?

When that day comes?
*119149*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_surtr_secbrk05_030_mmr:60-2540]]
I’ve seen enough of war between the gods.
*119150*
[[S:::2821-5353]]
But you, little brother… who can say?
*119151*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_resume01_010_mmr:80-3620]]
I was going to tell you of Sköll & Hati, the bringers of day and night.
*119152*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_resume02_010_mmr:120-3750]]
Sköll & Hati, the wolf-giants, were captured as pups by Odin.
*119153*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_resume03_010_mmr:440-2750]]
The Sun and Moon stood still in defiance,
*119154*
[[S:::3100-6250]]
so Odin put the wolf-giants, Sköll & Hati, to work.
*119155*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_resume04_010_mmr:70-2550]]
When the Sun and Moon refused to rise and set,
*119156*
[[S:::3050-7000]]
Odin cast the wolf-giants Sköll & Hati into the heavens to give chase.
*119157*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_resume05_010_mmr:120-4810]]
Sköll & Hati, the wolf-giants, bring us day and night by chasing the sun and moon—
*119158*
[[S:::5210-7500]]
and they shall, until the day they catch them.
*119159*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_resume06_010_mmr:53-3690]]
We were discussing Sköll & Hati, and you had a question about Ragnarök..?
*119160*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_resume06_020_son:0-500]]
Yes…
*119161*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_resume07_010_mmr:550-2590]]
You had posed an excellent question—
*119162*
[[S:::3300-8500]]
why would Odin set Sköll & Hati to chase the sun if it helped fulfill the prophecy of Ragnarök..?
*119163*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_resume08_010_mmr:670-4120]]
Odin put Sköll & Hati in the sky for purposes of control.
*119164*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_secbrk00_010_mmr:460-4000]]
You’re familiar with the tale of Sköll & Hati, bringers of day and night?
*119165*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_secbrk00_020_son:30-650]]
Oh, yeah!
*119166*
[[S:::1020-1890]]
The wolf-giants!
*119167*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_secbrk00_030_mmr:50-550]]
Aye.
*119168*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_secbrk01_010_mmr:156-6350]]
Aye. They were born of the arch-wolf Hróðvitnir, a great nemesis of the Aesir gods.
*119169*
[[S:::6830-11758]]
Odin captured them as pups and kept them in the kennels of Asgard, to hold his foe at bay.
*119170*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_secbrk01_010_mmr_a:0-5000]]
They were born of the arch-wolf Hróðvitnir, a great nemesis of the Aesir gods.

*119172*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_secbrk02_010_mmr:75-5795]]
But when the sun and moon grew mutinous and stood still, Odin put Sköll and Hati to use.
*119173*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_secbrk03_010_mmr:300-4711]]
With his ancient magicks he cast the wolves to the heavens, and they began their chase.
*119174*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_secbrk04_010_mmr:60-1840]]
And long shall they chase,
*119175*
[[S:::2380-3790]]
but not endlessly—
*119176*
[[S:::4440-9750]]
for it is foretold that someday Sköll and Hati will catch and devour their prey.
*119177*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_secbrk05_010_mmr:110-3000]]
And that day shall be Ragnarök,
*119178*
[[S:::3720-5888]]
the twilight of the gods.
*119179*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_secbrk05_020_son:17-600]]
But…
*119180*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_secbrk06_010_son:50-675]]
But…
*119181*
[[S:::1410-4545]]
Ragnarök is supposed to be Odin’s doom, isn’t it?
*119182*
[[S:::5144-7628]]
Why would he set the wolves loose if it fulfils the prophecy?
*119183*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_secbrk06_010_son_a:48-2915]]
Ragnarök is supposed to be Odin’s doom, isn’t it?

[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_secbrk06_010_son_c:110-2750]]
Why would he set the wolves loose if it fulfils the prophecy?
*119186*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_secbrk06_020_mmr:520-2170]]
Precisely the question, lad.
*119187*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_secbrk06_010_son_b:30-3100]]
Ragnarök is supposed to be Odin’s doom, isn’t it?
*119188*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_secbrk07_010_mmr:70-1500]]
It’s always about control.
*119189*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_skollhati_secbrk08_010_mmr:70-5450]]
The wolves determine when Ragnarök begins, and now he controls the wolves.
*119190*
[[S:::5850-10364]]
A battle fought on his timetable is a battle he better stands to win.
*119191*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_resume01_010_mmr:430-3000]]
There was a Frost Giant King who was called Thrym…
*119192*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_resume02_010_mmr:440-4750]]
Thrym, the cunning Frost Giant King, had stolen Mjöllnir while Thor slept.
*119193*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_resume03_010_mmr:370-2430]]
Thrym the Cunning stole Thor’s hammer,
*119194*
[[S:::2800-6000]]
and ill-advisedly offered to trade it for Freya’s hand in marriage.
*119195*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_resume04_010_mmr:90-4050]]
Thrym the Cunning sought to ransom Thor’s stolen hammer for Freya’s hand,
*119196*
[[S:::4070-6500]]
presenting Odin with a rare opportunity.
*119197*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_resume05_010_mmr:490-4866]]
Odin sent Freya to marry Thrym the Cunning, while Thor, under magical concealment,
*119198*
[[S:::5143-8000]]
infiltrated Jötunheim in search of his stolen hammer.
*119199*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_resume06_010_mmr:550-5059]]
The wedding of Freya and Thrym the Cunning was interrupted when Thor recovered his hammer
*119200*
[[S:::5059-7750]]
and commenced a slaughter of legendary proportions.
*119201*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_resume07_010_mmr:120-5000]]
Thor’s massacre at the wedding of Thrym the Cunning was finally put to a halt by our friend Freya.
*119202*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_resume08_010_mmr:160-2500]]
Let’s see, Thrym the Cunning, where were we?
*119203*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_resume08_020_kra:20-1500]]
You were coming to the point.
*119204*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_resume08_030_mmr:148-770]]
Ah yes…
*119205*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_secbrk00_010_son:110-650]]
Mimir…
*119206*
[[S:::1310-3990]]
why don’t you tell us the story of the Giant that stole Thor’s hammer?
*119207*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_secbrk00_020_mmr:80-1220]]
Happily, m’boy.
*119208*
[[S:::1770-4070]]
It involves your friend Freya too,
*119209*
[[S:::4070-6610]]
though I don’t expect it’s one she’d enjoy being reminded of.
*119210*
[[S:::7120-9650]]
The giant was called Thrym…
*119211*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_secbrk01_010_mmr:80-4500]]
… and he proved cunning enough to make off with Mjöllnir while the thunder-lummox slept.
*119212*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_secbrk02_010_mmr:83-3536]]
Sadly for Thrym, he didn’t always think with his brain.
*119213*
[[S:::3536-7261]]
Though he had robbed the greatest Giant-killer of his greatest weapon,
*119214*
[[S:::7261-11762]]
he offered to trade it back to the Aesir in exchange for Freya as his bride.
*119215*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_secbrk02_010_mmr_a:50-3230]]
Sadly for Thrym, he didn’t always think with his brain.
*119216*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_secbrk02_010_mmr_b:140-3400]]
Though he had robbed the greatest Giant-killer of his greatest weapon,
*119217*
[[S:::3670-8030]]
he offered to trade it back to the Aesir in exchange for Freya as his bride.
*119218*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_secbrk03_010_mmr:110-4300]]
Now at this point, Freya was married to Odin, and Odin, frankly,
*119219*
[[S:::4300-7233]]
would have traded her for a sufficiently strong mead—BUT,
*119220*
[[S:::7843-9285]]
he saw an opportunity here.
*119221*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_secbrk04_010_mmr:520-5070]]
Thrym’s palace was in Jötunheim, and only Giants know the way.
*119222*
[[S:::5800-9750]]
By agreeing to the marriage, they’d have to escort Freya back to their realm.
*119223*
[[S:::10264-15518]]
So, Odin coerced Freya into using her seiðr magicks to conceal Thor,
*119224*
[[S:::15850-18759]]
so he could sneak along with her and infiltrate Jötunheim.
*119225*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_secbrk04_010_mmr_b:170-4000]]
By agreeing to the marriage, they’d have to escort Freya back to their realm.

*119227*

*119229*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_secbrk05_010_mmr_b:0-4550]]
He took back Mjölnir and wasted no time in smashing Thrym’s skull,
*119230*
[[S:::4780-7100]]
followed by every other Giant present for the festivities.
*119231*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_secbrk05_010_mmr:560-3030]]
When the hammer was produced as the wedding dowry,
*119232*
[[S:::3400-4822]]
Thor revealed himself.
*119233*
[[S:::5000-9433]]
He took back Mjölnir and wasted no time in smashing Thrym’s skull,
*119234*
[[S:::9868-12023]]
followed by every other giant present for the festivities.
*119235*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_secbrk04_010_mmr_a:520-2880]]
Thrym’s palace was in Jötunheim,
*119236*
[[S:::3260-5200]]
and only Giants know the way.
*119237*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_secbrk06_010_mmr:560-4750]]
The only thing that put a stop to it was Freya, who wanted no part of this massacre.
*119238*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_secbrk05_010_mmr_a:560-3030]]
When the hammer was produced as the wedding dowry,

[[S:::3400-4750]]
Thor revealed himself.
*119240*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_secbrk07_010_mmr:250-5080]]
She cast a powerful spell that hurtled them both out of Jötunheim with no means of return.
*119241*
[[S:::5620-10430]]
Odin was livid, hoping that Thor’s foothold in Jötunheim would become his own.
*119242*
[[S:::10880-14730]]
And oh, would he ever revenge himself upon Freya—
*119243*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_secbrk07_010_mmr_c:0-900]]
And oh,

What is the point of this story, head?
*119248*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_boatlore_thrym_secbrk08_010_mmr:520-3681]]
Well, for Thrym, the lesson would be to keep his priorities straight.
*119249*
[[S:::4044-6448]]
For Freya, it’s that doing good has a price.
*119250*
[[S:::6890-10494]]
For Thor, it’s that no object of power makes you what you are…
*119251*
[[S:::10752-16123]]
and if what you are is the biggest butchering bastard in the nine realms, nobody can take that away from you.

[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore1_sec1_cus_res_010_son:50-1500]]
What did you want to tell me about the Long War?
*119287*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore1_sec2_cus_res_010_son:46-1582]]
What were you saying about the Long War?
*119288*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore1_sec3_cus_res_010_son:40-3750]]
So, how did this “advisor of Odin’s” try to end the Long War?
*119289*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore1_sec4_cus_res_010_son:0-1590]]
Why would Freya agree to marry Odin?
*119290*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore1_secbrk00_010_son:40-490]]
Mimir,
*119291*
[[S:::1280-3250]]
you never did tell me why Freya spit in your face.
*119292*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore1_secbrk01_010_mmr:1060-6750]]
Well, she blames me in large measure for her present circumstances… and not totally without reason.
*119293*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore1_secbrk02_010_mmr:0-3500]]
It all goes back to the Long War between the Aesir and Vanir.
*119294*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore1_secbrk03_010_mmr:0-3000]]
Prior to that, wars for the Aesir were easily won—
*119295*
[[S:::3440-7000]]
but the Vanir had proved their equal, and exacted devastating damage.
*119296*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore1_secbrk04_010_mmr:0-2000]]
Both sides suffered tremendous losses…
*119297*
[[S:::2430-5990]]
and for many of us, quite frankly, war was simply no fun anymore,
*119298*
[[S:::6650-8910]]
but a rather senseless waste of precious life.
*119299*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore1_secbrk05_010_mmr:40-1000]]
Wouldn’t you agree, brother?
*119300*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore1_secbrk06_010_kra:12-654]]
Ngr.
*119301*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore1_secbrk07_010_mmr:10-817]]
Precisely.
*119302*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore1_secbrk08_010_mmr:30-880]]
Enough was enough—
*119303*
[[S:::1470-6000]]
and at last, Odin’s most brilliant advisor became determined to find a more enlightened path.
*119304*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore1_secbrk09_010_mmr:0-2250]]
He set about to broker a peace between the Gods.
*119305*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore1_secbrk10_010_mmr:20-4770]]
It took some convincing, but ultimately Odin was persuaded to marry his deadliest enemy—
*119306*
[[S:::5280-9680]]
a certain Vanir goddess, legendary not only for her fertile beauty
*119307*
[[S:::10100-14750]]
but her genius at the very Vanir magic that Odin had long aspired to master.
*119308*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore1_secbrk11_010_son:0-1190]]
Freya married Odin?
*119309*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore1_secbrk13_010_mmr:170-4000]]
It was a sacrifice to protect her people—a selfless act of love.
*119310*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore1_secbrk12_010_son:28-1040]]
What was in it for her?
*119311*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore1_secbrk14_010_mmr:0-2160]]
Truly, she deserves better than she got.
*119312*
[[S:::2910-5000]]
But of course there’s more to that story.
*119313*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_sec1_cus_res_010_son:60-1280]]
You were saying something about…
*119314*
[[S:::1860-3500]]
love and hate, being…
*119315*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_sec1_cus_res_020_mmr:50-1500]]
Intertwined… yes…
*119316*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_sec2_cus_res_010_son:0-2150]]
So you were saying Thor is half-god and half-giant?
*119317*
[[S:::2930-3750]]
That’s so weird.
*119318*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_sec2_cus_res_020_mmr:50-490]]
Aye,
*119319*
[[S:::1020-3000]]
but Odin and Fjörgyn’s love was true…
*119320*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_sec3_cus_res_010_son:0-1660]]
So were you saying Odin was lonely?
*119321*
[[S:::2300-3500]]
That’s why he was always at war?
*119322*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_sec3_cus_res_020_mmr:0-1300]]
Nothing quite so simple…
*119323*
[[S:::1810-5500]]
but I hoped that love might temper him, and give us a chance for peace.
*119324*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_sec4_cus_res_010_son:27-2232]]
So what was it like when Odin and Freya got married?
*119325*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_sec5_cus_res_010_son:35-2039]]
So Odin and Freya’s marriage wasn’t that bad?
*119326*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_sec5_cus_res_020_mmr:110-2250]]
Aye, for a while, it truly wasn’t.
*119327*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_sec6_cus_res_010_son:58-3819]]
So Odin and Freya could have been happy, but he only wanted her magic?
*119328*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_sec6_cus_res_020_mmr:70-850]]
Aye…
*119329*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_secbrk00_010_son:25-2154]]
I can’t believe Odin and Freya were ever married.
*119330*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_secbrk01_010_mmr:0-2750]]
Love and hate are more closely intertwined than you might imagine.
*119331*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_secbrk02_010_mmr:0-2690]]
For instance, Odin hates the Giants, and they him,
*119332*
[[S:::3060-6310]]
but Thor’s own mother was the Giantess Fjörgyn—
*119333*
[[S:::6700-8500]]
one of Odin’s great loves.
*119334*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_secbrk03_010_son:40-1780]]
So Thor is half-god and half-Giant?
*119335*
[[S:::2400-3000]]
Weird…!
*119336*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_secbrk04_010_mmr:30-4020]]
Once Fjörgyn was gone, lonely ages passed for Odin…
*119337*
[[S:::4420-9130]]
and as war with the Vanir raged, I could see what he really wanted beneath his bluster.
*119338*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_secbrk05_010_mmr:0-2750]]
And after no small amount of convincing, Freya agreed.
*119339*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_secbrk06_010_mmr:60-5210]]
For a while there, he really turned on the charm. He seemed happy. He seemed interested in making
*119340*
[[S:::5210-6000]]
her happy.
*119341*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_secbrk07_010_mmr:0-3000]]
He granted her so many wishes I can scarcely recall them all.
*119342*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_secbrk08_010_mmr:20-4500]]
The peace held, and I truly believed all had worked out better than I could have planned.
*119343*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_secbrk09_010_mmr:0-5650]]
But Odin’s true face showed itself again in the end. Oh he won Freya’s trust, and she taught him
*119344*
[[S:::5650-9000]]
some of her Vanir magic—another choice she would live to bitterly regret.
*119345*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_secbrk10_010_mmr:50-630]]
Sadly,
*119346*
[[S:::1160-4373]]
despite his wise counsellor's best efforts to persuade him
*119347*
[[S:::4373-7340]]
that peace was the only true path to stave off Ragnarök,
*119348*
[[S:::8000-10500]]
Odin never let go of his obsession with Jötunheim.
*119349*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore2_secbrk11_010_mmr:70-4360]]
The taste of Vanir magic led him to new forms of experimentation,
*119350*
[[S:::4720-6500]]
and new levels of depravity.
*119351*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore3_sec1_cus_res_010_son:47-3471]]
Mimir, you were telling us how Freya ended up living in the woods.
*119352*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore3_sec1_cus_res_020_mmr:40-1470]]
Aye… she’d married Odin…
*119353*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore3_sec2_cus_res_010_son:60-450]]
Mimir,
*119354*
[[S:::1590-3460]]
get to how Freya ended up living in the woods.
*119355*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore3_sec2_cus_res_020_mmr:53-3228]]
She’d finally reached her limit with Odin, and broke things off…
*119356*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore3_sec3_cus_res_010_son:20-3000]]
Okay, so… Freya left, and Odin was mad.
*119357*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore3_sec3_cus_res_020_mmr:30-3000]]
Furious—and he cursed her most terribly
*119358*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore3_sec4_cus_res_010_son:0-2000]]
So Odin robbed Freya of her warrior spirit?
*119359*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore3_sec4_cus_res_020_mmr:20-1093]]
Aye…
*119360*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore3_secbrk00_010_son:0-320]]
Okay,
*119361*
[[S:::800-2702]]
obviously the marriage with Odin didn’t last.
*119362*
[[S:::3460-5869]]
But how did Freya end up a hermit in the woods?
*119363*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore3_secbrk01_010_mmr:50-3000]]
Oh, that was a singular piece of cruelty, even for Odin.
*119364*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore3_secbrk02_010_mmr:16-2214]]
As if the marriage wasn’t punishment enough!
*119365*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore3_secbrk03_010_mmr:40-2000]]
Freya was better to him than he deserved.
*119366*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore3_secbrk04_010_mmr:0-2600]]
She stuck it out through all manner of indignity,
*119367*
[[S:::2815-5904]]
all in the name of maintaining peace, and safety for her people.
*119368*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore3_secbrk05_010_mmr:150-4042]]
But Odin’s madness, his Tyranny, his corruption of her magicks—
*119369*
[[S:::4204-7453]]
it became more than she could stomach, and at long last she broke it off.
*119370*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore3_secbrk06_010_mmr:0-4250]]
Odin’s wrath was fierce, and his curses upon her were more than she’d dared to fear.
*119371*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore3_secbrk07_010_son:26-1809]]
But her magic was so much stronger than his…
*119372*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore3_secbrk08_010_mmr:40-2978]]
After so much time together, he knew her vulnerabilities,
*119373*
[[S:::3221-6250]]
and exploited them to craft curses she could never break.
*119374*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore3_secbrk09_010_son:160-780]]
Oh…
*119375*
[[S:::1260-2820]]
like not being able to leave Midgard.
*119376*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore3_secbrk10_010_mmr:40-2492]]
Worse still, he robbed her of her warrior spirit.
*119377*
[[S:::2919-6061]]
Freya cannot fight—even to defend herself.
*119378*
[[S:::6364-10254]]
No living thing may she harm, by blade nor spell.
*119379*
[[S:::10690-14613]]

[[S:::3390-4586]]
I’d spit in your face too.
*119387*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_OdnLore3_secbrk12_010_mmr:60-850]]
Aye, lad.
*119388*
[[S:::1650-2250]]
So would I.
*119389*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_TyrOdin_sec1_cus_res_010_son:0-550]]
So…
*119390*
[[S:::1010-3000]]
why was Týr helping Odin meet with the Giant Kings?
*119391*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_TyrOdin_sec2_cus_res_010_son:44-2232]]
So what happened when Týr brought Odin to Jotunheim?
*119392*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_TyrOdin_sec3_cus_res_010_son:60-2250]]
So what happened after Odin was cast out of Jötunheim? 
*119393*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_TyrOdin_secbrk00_010_son:0-450]]
Mimir…
*119394*
[[S:::1490-4500]]
why did you say Týr felt responsible for what Odin did to the Giants?
*119395*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_TyrOdin_secbrk01_010_mmr:400-3290]]
There was an incident, shortly after the forging of Mjölnir,
*119396*
[[S:::3650-7000]]
when Týr arranged a diplomatic meeting between Odin and the Giant Kings.
*119397*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_TyrOdin_secbrk02_010_mmr:170-3759]]
This was when the Long War was young, when victory was still a thing dreamed of,
*119398*
[[S:::3759-7000]]
and the Jötnar might have tipped the balance between Aesir and Vanir.
*119399*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_TyrOdin_secbrk03_010_mmr:0-3265]]
Odin had persuaded Týr that the hammer was merely a deterrent—
*119400*
[[S:::3391-5750]]
a means to broker peace from a position of strength.
*119401*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_TyrOdin_secbrk04_010_mmr:60-4000]]
Týr was hopeful to convince all parties they would prosper best through peace.
*119402*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_TyrOdin_secbrk05_010_mmr:0-2420]]
He knew the Giants were deeply concerned about the hammer,
*119403*
[[S:::2830-5340]]
a super-weapon in hands they did not trust.
*119404*
[[S:::5880-7220]]
But they trusted Týr.
*119405*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_TyrOdin_secbrk06_010_mmr:0-5130]]
Týr always believed the best in people—and taking Odin at his word in his desire for peace,
*119406*
[[S:::5520-7250]]
he brought the Raven King to Jötunheim.
*119407*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_TyrOdin_secbrk07_010_mmr:430-2250]]
From there, things unravelled quickly.
*119408*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_TyrOdin_secbrk08_010_mmr:0-4050]]
The Giants anticipated Odin’s trickery, and exposed his true agenda,
*119409*
[[S:::4170-6250]]
to spy and steal their secret wisdom.
*119410*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_TyrOdin_secbrk09_010_mmr:50-4410]]
With magicks, they expelled Odin from their realm, and cursed him never to return.
*119411*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_TyrOdin_secbrk10_010_mmr:0-760]]
Frustrated,
*119412*
[[S:::1210-4000]]
Odin visited his fury upon the Giants of Midgard.
*119413*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_TyrOdin_secbrk11_010_mmr:220-3656]]
Thor unleashed Mjölnir’s might upon any Giant he could find.
*119414*
[[S:::3836-7250]]
None could stand against the tide of slaughter that followed.
*119415*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_TyrOdin_secbrk12_010_mmr:40-3540]]
And at last it seems, with Týr’s aid, they retreated.
*119416*
[[S:::3813-6732]]
The tower disappeared, no Giants could be found in Midgard,
*119417*
[[S:::7236-11152]]
and no man nor god has set foot in Jötunheim since.
*119418*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_MagModLore_sec1_cus_res_010_son:60-2250]]
So what happened after Hrungnir fell down on Thor?
*119419*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_MagModLore_sec2_cus_res_010_son:0-2620]]
So what happened after Magni and Modi got Hrungnir off Thor?
*119420*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_MagModLore_secbrk00_010_son:49-3867]]
Mmir… you never told us what Magni and Modi had to do with Hrungnir.
*119421*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_MagModLore_secbrk01_010_mmr:540-1180]]
Oh, yes.
*119422*
[[S:::1650-4790]]
Well, what happened after Hrungnir fell slain upon Thor,
*119423*
[[S:::5040-8450]]
was that nobody in the court could get the stone body off of him.
*119424*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_MagModLore_secbrk02_010_mmr:23-3838]]
Thor was no use at this point—his brain rattled, his breath shallow…
*119425*
[[S:::4267-7223]]
but none of Odin’s men were nearly strong enough to help.
*119426*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_MagModLore_secbrk03_010_mmr:0-3580]]
Then enter little Magni and Modi, no taller than shrubs,
*119427*
[[S:::4110-6316]]
and while nobody but myself was looking,
*119428*
[[S:::6658-9500]]
they flipped over Hrungnir’s corpse and freed their father.
*119429*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_MagModLore_secbrk04_010_mmr:80-3091]]
Magni, being blonder, got all the credit,
*119430*
[[S:::3373-6805]]
and Modi remained bitter about it, from that day to the end…
*119431*
[[S:::7145-8747]]
which, I don’t need to tell you about.
*119432*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Goodfellow_sec1_cus_res_010_mmr:40-2490]]
Where were we then? Oh yes—my career!
*119433*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Goodfellow_sec2_cus_res_010_mmr:80-940]]
Where were we then?
*119434*
[[S:::1380-2500]]
Oh yes—my first job
*119435*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Goodfellow_sec3_cus_res_010_mmr:90-4750]]
Let’s see… my first job! Right! Me n’ m’mates, in the employ of a faerie king.
*119436*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Goodfellow_sec4_cus_res_010_mmr:0-1690]]
Let’s see… my first job! Right!
*119437*
[[S:::2230-6000]]
Me n’ m’mates had the run of the forest, as long as we kept the faerie king amused.
*119438*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_Goodfellow_secbrk00_010_son:0-520]]
Mimir,
*119439*
[[S:::1350-3140]]
why did you work for Odin if he’s so horrible?
*119440*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Goodfellow_secbrk01_010_mmr:60-2038]]
It’s my career!
*119441*
[[S:::2400-7499]]
And if you mean to make your career as a counsellor to kings, you can’t very well rule out petty maniacs—
*119442*
[[S:::7828-9500]]
available positions are scarce enough!
*119443*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Goodfellow_secbrk02_010_mmr:30-2662]]
My first master was a cruel piece of work as well,
*119444*
[[S:::2781-5775]]
but I learned through him the enduring power of wit,
*119445*
[[S:::6010-8250]]
which served me well with kings and gods alike.
*119446*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Goodfellow_secbrk03_010_mmr:28-5023]]
I couldn’t have been much older than you when I started—a faerie king’s errand boy, and unofficial jester.
*119447*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Goodfellow_secbrk04_010_mmr:0-480]]
By night,
*119448*
[[S:::840-2250]]
my mates and I had the run of the forest.
*119449*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Goodfellow_secbrk05_010_mmr:16-3204]]
Goodfellows, they called us—knavish sprites to the last.
*119450*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Goodfellow_secbrk06_010_mmr:260-4310]]
We’d get up to all manner of mischief, making fools of the local mortals—
*119451*
[[S:::4730-8500]]
but as long as our lord was kept amused, we were spared the consequences.
*119452*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Goodfellow_secbrk07_010_mmr:2180-3640]]
Then one day, he was not amused,
*119453*
[[S:::4460-5960]]
and I saw fit to move on.
*119454*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Goodfellow_secbrk08_010_mmr:0-4660]]
Thankfully the ages and roads travelled since then have turned me from that merry wanderer
*119455*
[[S:::5250-8020]]
into the paragon of virtue you see before you today.
*119456*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_MmrOnWell_sec1_cus_res_010_mmr:70-970]]
Where was I?
*119457*
[[S:::1570-3250]]
Coming north, making a new start…
*119458*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_MmrOnWell_sec2_cus_res_010_mmr:0-3750]]
Now I believe I was just acquainting Odin with my mystic well of knowledge…
*119459*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_MmrOnWell_sec3_cus_res_010_mmr:50-550]]
Aye
*119460*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_MmrOnWell_sec3_cus_res_010_son:0-1630]]
So Odin gouged out his own eye? ’
*119461*
[[S:::2540-3860]]
Cause of mushrooms you gave him?
*119462*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_MmrOnWell_secbrk00_010_son:0-650]]
Mimir,
*119463*
[[S:::1260-2669]]
how’d you come to be in these lands?
*119464*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_MmrOnWell_secbrk01_010_mmr:170-5750]]
Lad, there comes a time in every man’s life when he changes his name and heads North to make a new start.
*119465*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_MmrOnWell_secbrk02_010_mmr:0-4500]]
If you live long enough to do this many times over, you might end up as far North as this place.
*119466*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_MmrOnWell_secbrk03_010_mmr:20-3470]]
By the time I arrived, I already knew Odin by his reputation—
*119467*
[[S:::4010-8679]]
and so I set to demonstrate my worth by coming to him with something I knew he’d value—
*119468*
[[S:::9010-11023]]
a mystic well of knowledge.
*119469*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_MmrOnWell_secbrk04_010_mmr:0-5750]]
Or rather, I should say, a well of water laced with enough mystic mushrooms to make a god see visions.
*119470*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_MmrOnWell_secbrk05_010_mmr:410-2500]]
Oh, he was rightly impressed.
*119471*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_MmrOnWell_secbrk06_010_mmr:35-3685]]
Can’t say for sure what he saw that led him to try gouging out his own eyes,
*119472*
[[S:::4005-6358]]
but I managed to restrain him before he finished the job.
*119473*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_MmrOnWell_secbrk07_010_mmr:0-5791]]
Then I persuaded him it had been his sacrifice, made for an even higher form of sight to be bestowed,
*119474*
[[S:::6028-7541]]
blah-de-blah-de-blah-de-blah.
*119475*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_MmrOnWell_secbrk08_010_mmr:20-1490]]
I used to think he never caught on.
*119476*
[[S:::2110-5750]]
But the day he took my eye, I realised he had never been fooled.
*119477*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_MmrOnWell_secbrk09_010_mmr:20-1418]]
He knew I’d outwitted him,
*119478*
[[S:::1767-5561]]
called the lesson wisdom, and hired me, to make sure from then on I was on his side.
*119479*
[[S:::5938-8378]]
And for a long, long time, I truly was.
*119480*
[[S:::9230-11098]]
Doesn’t mean he didn’t hold a grudge.
*119481*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_sec1_cus_res_010_mmr:0-2500]]
I believe we were discussing my youthful ambitions…
*119482*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_sec2_cus_res_010_mmr:0-4000]]
I believe I was sayin’… The Aesir had power, but lacked for strategy…
*119483*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_sec3_cus_res_010_mmr:80-750]]
Where was I then?
*119484*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_sec3_cus_res_020_son:0-2200]]
You’d become Odin’s most trusted advisor.
*119485*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_sec3_cus_res_030_mmr:0-700]]
Aye
*119486*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_sec4_cus_res_010_son:8-2052]]
So what did you do to get Odin so mad at you?
*119487*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_sec5_cus_res_010_son:42-2965]]
Mimir—you were getting to how Odin turned on you.
*119488*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_sec5_cus_res_020_mmr:0-2000]]
Well, I felt my duty to Odin had evolved…
*119489*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_sec5_cus_res_020_mmr_a:260-2500]]
Well, I felt my duty to Odin had evolved…
*119490*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_sec6_cus_res_010_mmr:0-1030]]
To finish what I was saying—
*119491*
[[S:::1500-5750]]
I tried to serve Odin by serving peace, and he took it as disloyalty.
*119492*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_secbrk00_010_son:70-560]]
Mimir,
*119493*
[[S:::1100-3600]]
I still don’t get why you ever wanted to work for Odin.
*119494*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_secbrk01_010_mmr:20-2250]]
Back then, I was young enough to still be ambitious.
*119495*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_secbrk02_010_mmr:30-3161]]
The Aesir gods were as powerful a force as I’d come across,
*119496*
[[S:::3420-7123]]
but they clearly lacked for strategy, focus, and sage counsel.
*119497*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_secbrk03_010_mmr:0-2000]]
All this could I faithfully provide.
*119498*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_secbrk04_010_mmr:60-4267]]
And so, a stranger from a far-off island found himself with Odin’s ear,
*119499*
[[S:::4667-7000]]
trusted as he trusted no one but himself.
*119500*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_secbrk05_010_mmr:40-2640]]
And with that kind of power, laddie, I must confess—
*119501*
[[S:::3010-3750]]
there are perks.
*119502*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_secbrk06_010_son:0-1792]]
Yeah, but he’s Odin!
*119503*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_secbrk07_010_mmr:30-2510]]
I never claimed to be perfect, laddie, only clever.
*119504*
[[S:::3300-4750]]
And often too clever by half.
*119505*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_secbrk08_010_son:26-1993]]
So what did you to do get Odin so mad at you?
*119506*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_secbrk09_010_mmr:60-560]]
Well,
*119507*
[[S:::940-5290]]
for a long time, my job was to enable Odin, and I was fucking excellent at it.
*119508*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_secbrk10_010_mmr:0-3390]]
Gradually, as I grew more to care about… people, and the world,
*119509*
[[S:::3960-5500]]
my job became to contain him.
*119510*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_secbrk11_010_mmr:50-1500]]
To protect him from himself.
*119511*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_secbrk12_010_mmr:0-3400]]
By serving peace, I served his interests as well, that’s the truth…
*119512*
[[S:::4020-5500]]
but he saw it as disloyalty.
*119513*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_secbrk13_010_mmr:0-3890]]
No longer trusting my motives, but not wishing to part with my brain or tongue,
*119514*
[[S:::4400-8900]]
he bound me to a tree and adopted a new pastime of casual torture.
*119515*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_secbrk14_010_son:25-2692]]
Well, I’m glad we came along to cut off your head.
*119516*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Mmr_Odin_secbrk15_010_mmr:50-960]]
Aye, lad.
*119517*
[[S:::1360-2410]]
Lucky break that was.
*119518*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_sec1_cus_res_010_mmr:60-4930]]
What were we into, then? Oh! The revenge plot of Hrimthur, the stone mason’s son.
*119519*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_sec2_cus_res_010_mmr:130-960]]
We were at…
*119520*
[[S:::1380-5750]]
the stone mason’s son, plotting revenge, observed the shoddiness of Asgard’s walls.
*119521*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_sec3_cus_res_010_mmr:190-5000]]
So then! Hrimthur, the stone mason’s son in disguise, offered to fix Asgard’s walls.
*119522*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_sec4_cus_res_010_mmr:280-5750]]
Alright, the stone mason’s son, Hrimthur—he builds Asgard a great wall, and demands his prize
*119523*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_sec5_cus_res_010_son:40-2780]]
So… Hrimthur just wanted to whisper in Freya’s ear?
*119524*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_sec5_cus_res_020_mmr:30-1000]]
Aye…
*119525*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_sec6_cus_res_010_mmr:80-4800]]
We’d come to the part where Thor caught up with Hrimthur, and slew the stone mason’s son.
*119526*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_sec7_cus_res_020_son:30-2250]]
So what did the stone mason’s son whisper to Freya?
*119527*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_secbrk00_010_son:30-3420]]
Mimir, you never told me what happened with the stonemason’s son.
*119528*
[[S:::4240-5430]]
You said he’d have his revenge.
*119529*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_secbrk01_010_mmr_b:79-3246]]
I said he’d plot his revenge, and so he did.
*119530*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_secbrk00_010_son_b:50-1250]]
You said he’d have his revenge.
*119531*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_secbrk01_010_mmr:20-1510]]
Hrimthur, son of Thamur?
*119532*
[[S:::1900-4950]]
I said he’d plot his revenge, and so he did.
*119533*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_secbrk00_010_son_a:30-450]]
Mimir,
*119534*
[[S:::960-3000]]
you never told me what happened with the stonemason’s son.
*119535*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_secbrk01_010_mmr_a:30-1500]]
Hrimthur, son of Thamur?
*119536*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_secbrk02_010_mmr:50-3968]]
After completing his father’s masterwork, the Great Wall of Jötunheim,
*119537*
[[S:::4240-8617]]
he thought of nothing but making the Aesir pay for their crimes against the Giants.
*119538*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_secbrk03_010_mmr:0-4360]]
Once he longed to fight Thor, but tragedy had brought wisdom to Hrimthur—
*119539*
[[S:::4720-5750]]
and cunning.
*119540*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_secbrk04_010_mmr:300-4276]]
He observed that Asgard’s walls were half-built and shoddy,
*119541*
[[S:::4464-7500]]
for no Aesir god could be bothered with such tiresome labour.
*119542*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_secbrk05_010_mmr:0-4540]]
So Hrimthur adopted the guise of an ordinary man, and made the Aesir an offer—
*119543*
[[S:::5080-7300]]
he would build them majestic new walls,
*119544*
[[S:::7300-9360]]
and if he couldn’t build them within two turns of the season,
*119545*
[[S:::9360-11200]]
they would owe him nothing for his labours.
*119546*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_secbrk06_010_mmr:30-1130]]
And if he succeeded,
*119547*
[[S:::1690-4656]]
he asked only for an audience with the goddess Freya.
*119548*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_secbrk07_010_mmr:180-4750]]
Odin agreed, knowing the task was impossible, but intrigued by this stranger.
*119549*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_secbrk08_010_mmr:0-4120]]
Hrimthur made short work of it, of course—he had the benefit of his father’s training,
*119550*
[[S:::4120-6500]]
and the aid of a magical stallion for fetching stones.
*119551*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_secbrk09_010_mmr:100-3739]]
Odin was not happy to find himself on the losing end of the wager,
*119552*
[[S:::4057-6420]]
but he seemed to uphold his end of the bargain.
*119553*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_secbrk10_010_mmr:0-1530]]
Freya was sent to meet the mason,
*119554*
[[S:::2030-5000]]
and to her surprise, he wanted only to whisper something in her ear.
*119555*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_secbrk11_010_mmr:120-3010]]
That being done, he made his way out of Asgard…
*119556*
[[S:::3870-8314]]
and when he found Thor awaiting him at the gates of Midgard, he knew he had been double-crossed.
*119557*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_secbrk12_010_mmr:22-4557]]
But he didn’t care, because his plan was complete.
*119558*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_secbrk13_010_son:60-760]]
It was?
*119559*
[[S:::1630-2607]]
What did he say to Freya?
*119560*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_secbrk14_010_mmr:0-3500]]
Only she could say for certain, but I’ve had many moons to work it out.
*119561*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_secbrk15_010_mmr:440-4340]]
Hrimthur knew that Freya loathed the Aesir, despite her marriage to Odin,
*119562*
[[S:::4730-7500]]
and I believe he gave her the secret to Asgard’s defences.
*119563*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_glo_boatlore_Hrimthur_secbrk16_010_mmr:20-3589]]
Some weakness he may have built in, structural or magical,
*119564*
[[S:::3816-9800]]
which I expect will be exploited come Ragnarök when Surtr arrives to burn Asgard to ash.
*119565*
[[S:::10180-11130]]
If not sooner.
*119566*

I’m talked out, lad.

But some day I imagine I’ll be telling your story.
*119571*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro03_s620_010_son_stem:2945-3609]]
What was that—?
*119572*
[[S::vo_lvl_pro03_s620_010_kra_stem:3820-4553]]
Your bow..!
*119573*
[[S:::26794-28327]]
Who are you?!
*119574*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro03_s010_010_son:32-4038]]
We’re finally home… feels like a lifetime ago.
*119575*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pro03_s010_020_mmr:27-4161]]
Bit drafty maybe, but it’s a right improvement over having tree bark in your tadger.
*119576*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro03_s030_010_son:30-4910]]
Can’t believe it was next to mother’s garden this whole time! No wonder we could never get in there.
*119577*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro03_s030_010_kra:20-1000]]
Time to rest.
*119578*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro03_s030_020_son:10-1311]]
I’m gonna sleep through winter!

[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_pro03_s030_030_mmr:60-2080]]
Okay… this’ll do.

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro03_s030_050_son:120-390]]
Oh!

*119583*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro03_s040_010_kra:0-500]]
Sleep.

Atreus, are you ready?

[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro03_s050_020_son:0-630]]
Yeah, but…
*119587*
[[S:::1330-2560]]
I had the weirdest dream.
*119588*
[[S:::3510-4760]]
Fimbulwinter was ending.
*119589*
[[S:::5490-6640]]
And Thor came for us,
*119590*
[[S:::7180-8000]]
here at the house.
*119591*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro03_s050_030_kra:0-1310]]
It was only a dream.
*119592*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_pro03_s050_040_son:80-1130]]
But it felt different.
*119593*
[[S:::2340-3230]]
It felt real…
*119594*
[[S:::4070-4720]]
it felt like
*119595*
[[S:::6140-6750]]
the future.
*119596*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_pro03_s050_050_kra:0-1990]]
Then we will worry about it tomorrow.
*119597*
[[S:::2710-3380]]
Today,
*119598*
[[S:::3850-5630]]
there are still things we can do.
*119599*
[[S:::6590-7000]]
Come.
*119600*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s005_010_son:0-880]]
This place.
*119601*
[[S:::1930-2630]]
It feels like….
*119602*
[[S:::4120-4750]]
like a prison.
*119603*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s005_020_mmr:60-2750]]
That would explain the hefty magical lock on the outside.
*119604*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s005_020_mmr_a:40-2740]]
That would explain the hefty magical lock on the outside.
*119605*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s005_030_son:55-6086]]
But it’s more than that. I have this feeling… like something is waiting for us down here.
*119606*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s005_040_mmr:0-2500]]
You’ve a knack for ominous statements, lad.
*119607*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_valkyrie_s005_050_kra:0-1000]]
What kind of something?
*119608*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s005_060_son:12-3075]]
I’m not sure. Something powerful.
*119609*

Whatever you feel, boy…
*119610*
[[S:::1850-2830]]
we will handle it.

Yes, father.
*119613*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s010_010_mmr:0-800]]
A Valkyrie…
*119614*
[[S:::1210-2200]]
imprisoned?
*119615*
[[S:::3010-4500]]
She actually did it.
*119616*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s010_020_son:40-720]]
A Valkyrie?
*119617*

Take caution, lads.
*119619*
[[S:::1770-3150]]
A Valkyrie in the flesh…
*119620*

I can’t think of a more formidable opponent.
*119621*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_valkyrie_s010_040_kra:0-1000]]
She does not attack.
*119622*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s010_050_son:0-1210]]
Does she even know we’re here?
*119623*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s010_060_son:1150-2490]]
Whoah! I think she knows we’re here now!
*119624*

It’s another Valkyrie.
*119625*

A Valkyrie… imprisoned?
*119626*

What is that, Mimir?
*119824*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s035_030_mmr:0-2990]]
It’s a Council Chamber, of sorts, hidden away in Midgard.
*119825*
[[S:::3350-7220]]
The Valkyries would often need a place to confer outside of Odin’s prying eyes.
*119826*
[[S:::7690-10050]]
They thought themselves properly concealed, but
*119827*
[[S:::10610-13250]]

We weren’t far from it, on our way to Thamur’s Chisel.
*119830*
[[S:::2940-5750]]

*119836*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s035_100_mmr:30-2590]]
It’s to the left of the two Oarsmen statues.

I didn’t call it out for what it was at the time…
*119838*

We’ll find something there. I’m certain of it.
*119842*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_valkyrie_s040_010_kra:40-1000]]
Another Valkyrie…
*119843*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s040_020_mmr:20-1890]]
We should probably do something about them.
*119844*

She was more…

I’m sorry, Mimir.

We’ll find her.

[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s065_040_mmr:0-1710]]
Not sure she wants to be found.
*120000*

I just don’t understand why she would do this. It doesn’t make a lick of sense.

[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_valkyrie_s065_050_kra:34-1691]]
And if she is responsible?
*120002*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s065_060_mmr:13-5211]]
Then we’ll have to stop her. The Valkyries must be freed, and we’re the only ones capable.

The Valkyrie….

[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s130_030_son_a:40-1000]]
We’re not going to fight her?
*120313*

We’re not going to fight her?
*120314*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_valkyrie_s130_020_kra:40-1500]]
We will face her some other time.

Not yet.
*120316*

For now.
*120320*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s130_070_son:36-1099]]
Shouldn’t we fight her?
*120321*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_valkyrie_s130_080_kra:50-750]]
Another time.

[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s130_090_son:120-630]]
Yeah,

*120327*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_valkyrie_s130_100_kra:140-1020]]
A wise thought.

*120354*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s135_100_son_a:80-500]]
Well,

[[S:::970-1890]]
here we are again.
*120356*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s135_100_son:90-1500]]

Well,

here we are again.
*120359*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s140_010_son:60-1000]]
What is this place?
*120360*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s140_020_mmr:38-3432]]
Hmm… Could it be?  The eight thrones…
*120361*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_valkyrie_s140_030_kra:0-1310]]
Stop being coy, Head.
*120362*
[[S:::1690-3000]]
Do you know this place or not?
*120363*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s140_040_mmr:40-3250]]
I’m Mimir, The Smartest Man alive! I know many things!
*120364*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s140_050_son:30-440]]
Well,
*120365*
[[S:::1130-2230]]
whatever this place is,
*120366*
[[S:::2900-3650]]
it looks important.
*120367*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_valkyrie_s140_060_kra:0-400]]
To who?
*120368*
[[S:::1220-2940]]
There is little of value here.
*120369*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s140_070_son:60-910]]
This is it, right?
*120370*
[[S:::1600-2250]]
The Rǫcstóll?
*120371*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s140_080_mmr:0-2500]]
Aye, lad. The Council of Valkyries.
*120372*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_valkyrie_s140_090_kra:30-2500]]
The Valkyries are of Valhalla, are they not?
*120373*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s140_100_mmr:0-1730]]
Glad to see you’re paying attention, brother!
*120374*
[[S:::2090-7360]]
You are correct. Valhalla, the Great Hall of the Einherjar, is their home within Asgard.
*120375*
[[S:::7760-11680]]
But while there,they are subject to the scrutiny of the Allfather himself.
*120376*
[[S:::12260-14680]]
And relations between the Valkyries and Odin were…
*120377*
[[S:::15160-17500]]
tense, during my tenure as his advisor.
*120378*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s140_110_son:43-557]]
Why?
*120379*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s140_120_mmr:30-4990]]
Well, that’s an even LONGER story, lad. For now, why don’t we look around for some clues?
*120380*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s140_130_mmr:50-2750]]
Try placing one of the Valkyrie helms on a throne.
*120381*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s140_140_son:57-1666]]
Whoah… You’re back!
*120382*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s140_150_son:22-1668]]
Uh… Hello?
*120383*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s140_160_mmr:0-1420]]
I don’t think she can hear you, lad.
*120384*
[[S:::1830-4980]]
The helms must only retain but a small portion of their owner.
*120385*
[[S:::5570-8010]]
I’d wager the rest is in transit to Valhalla—
*120386*
[[S:::8410-10750]]
to try and fix the mess left by their absence.
*120387*
[[S:SIGRUN:vo_glo_valkyrie_s150_010_sig:100-1420]]
Thank you, friends.
*120388*
[[S:::1910-4000]]
You have saved the Valkyries.
*120389*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s150_020_mmr:0-800]]
Sigrun…
*120390*
[[S:::1390-2500]]
How did this happen?
*120391*
[[S:SIGRUN:vo_glo_valkyrie_s150_030_sig:0-650]]
Mimir,
*120392*
[[S:::1190-2030]]
is that you?
*120393*
[[S:::2630-3730]]
You have been freed,
*120394*
[[S:::4110-4410]]
but…
*120395*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s150_040_mmr:20-1750]]
Freedom comes at a price, milady.
*120396*
[[S:SIGRUN:vo_glo_valkyrie_s150_050_sig:240-1360]]
You speak truly.
*120397*
[[S:::2240-4510]]
Countless winters, we served the Allfather.
*120398*
[[S:::5230-9750]]
But only through his union to the Queen, did we ever taste some measure of freedom.
*120399*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s150_060_son:40-1399]]
But aren’t you the Queen?
*120400*
[[S:SIGRUN:vo_glo_valkyrie_s150_070_sig:20-2450]]
There has only been one Queen of the Valkyries—
*120401*
[[S:::2850-4070]]
the Goddess Freya.
*120402*
[[S:::4910-11150]]
When Odin severed her wings,I served in her absence. But it wasn’t enough for the Allfather.
*120403*
[[S:::11800-15320]]
He used an archaic piece of magick, corrupting my sisters.
*120404*
[[S:::16110-20560]]
I tried to contain the damage by imprisoning them in places where they could cause no harm, but
*120405*
[[S:::21130-22660]]
soon… I lost myself as well.
*120406*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s150_080_mmr:40-2410]]
Sigrun, I’m sorry for being so worthless.
*120407*
[[S:::2950-5480]]
I could have done something. Or tried, at the very least.
*120408*
[[S:::6150-6950]]
What will you do now?
*120409*
[[S:SIGRUN:vo_glo_valkyrie_s150_090_sig:120-2170]]
I must reunite with my sisters.
*120410*
[[S:::2770-5340]]
Together, we can restore balance to the realms.
*120411*
[[S:::6380-9650]]
You have the eternal blessings of the Valkyries.
*120412*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s155_010_mmr:110-1550]]
Well… we did it.
*120413*
[[S:::1930-2500]]
I suppose.
*120414*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s155_020_son:28-1744]]
You don’t sound very happy about it.
*120415*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s155_030_mmr:100-3310]]
It’s difficult to be happy about anything when you’re a reanimated head.
*120416*
[[S:::4130-6710]]
I’m grateful we were able to set the Valkyries free…
*120417*
[[S:::7250-9750]]
but so much of this could have been avoided. If only…
*120418*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_valkyrie_s155_040_kra:0-1410]]
You said it yourself, Head.
*120419*
[[S:::1850-3150]]
It does not matter anymore.
*120420*
[[S:::3930-5250]]
The past is the past.
*120421*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s155_050_mmr:60-2500]]
Well, that’s awfully cheerful coming from you.
*120422*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_valkyrie_s155_060_kra:70-1170]]
I am in a good mood.
*120423*
[[S:::1800-3420]]
The dwarves will make use of this Helm.
*120424*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s155_070_mmr:60-2250]]
Your da’s a wee bit single-minded, isn’t he, lad.
*120425*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s155_080_son:17-895]]
Definitely.
*120426*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s160_010_son:30-420]]
Wait…
*120427*
[[S:::890-3299]]
So Freya is the Valkyrie Queen?!
*120428*
[[S:::4140-6854]]
She never told us… You never told us!
*120429*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_valkyrie_s160_020_kra:40-2880]]
Explain yourself, Head. Or are you bewitched again?
*120430*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s160_030_mmr:40-1140]]
Not at all!
*120431*
[[S:::1560-4050]]
Freya was Queen of the Valkyries at one point.
*120432*
[[S:::4520-7940]]
Part of her marriage dowry included overseeing the Valkyries themselves.
*120433*
[[S:::8470-11140]]
As a powerful Vanir Goddess, they revered her.
*120434*
[[S:::11560-13000]]
I never knew how much until now.
*120435*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s160_040_son:30-930]]
So what happened?
*120436*
[[S:::1930-3353]]
Why isn’t she the queen anymore?
*120437*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s160_050_mmr:160-3850]]
As Sigrun mentioned, Odin and Freya had a falling out.
*120438*
[[S:::3850-6470]]
He ripped her wings off, and stripped her of all titles.
*120439*
[[S:::6770-9790]]
The Valkyries were devastated. And Freya, well…
*120440*
[[S:::10310-12080]]
let’s not mention any of this to her, aye?
*120441*
[[S:::12460-14500]]
It’s a bit of a sore spot, to say the least.
*120442*
[[S:BROK:vo_glo_valkyrie_s165_010_brk:0-4420]]
Well, lookey here! What IS this fine-feckled slap o’ gold?
*120443*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_valkyrie_s165_020_kra:50-1250]]
It is a Valkyrie Helm.
*120444*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s165_030_son:60-1500]]
The QUEEN Valkyrie’s Helm.
*120445*

*120446*

*120464*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_valkyrie_s165_120_sin:0-4500]]
I suppose if we reuse the original enchantment… and apply the correct mold…
*120465*
[[S:BROK:vo_glo_valkyrie_s165_130_brk:370-2750]]
I been cooking up a new design as well…

Impossible!

Is that a Valkyrie helm?
*120470*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s170_030_son:40-1615]]
The QUEEN Valkyrie’s Helm.
*120471*
[[S:SINDRI:vo_glo_valkyrie_s170_040_sin:20-2570]]

It’s impossible! No way! No,
*120477*
[[S:::6820-7670]]
I—although…
*120478*
[[S:::8450-13000]]
I suppose if we reuse the original enchantment… and apply the correct mould…
*120479*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_valkyrie_s170_070_kra:70-750]]

[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_010_son:90-490]]

[[S:::1110-1750]]
who is she?
*120482*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_020_mmr:30-1850]]
Gunnr, Mistress of War.
*120483*
[[S:::2510-7370]]
After any conflict, big or small, she would be first on the scene, sussing out the worthy spirits
*120484*
[[S:::7370-8750]]
for a free trip to Valhalla.
*120485*
[[S:::9460-12250]]
A gruesome task, but she took great pride in it.

[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_030_kra_a:50-1110]]
Any conflict?
*120489*
[[S:::1680-2240]]
Impossible.
*120490*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_040_mmr:0-770]]
It’s true!
*120491*
[[S:::1260-5570]]
She had help from her sisters, of course. But Gunnr was always first to arrive.
*120492*
[[S:::6120-10920]]
Her judgement of the fallen was unparalleled, and an invaluable resource to Odin.
*120493*
[[S:::11320-12750]]
She was one of his favourites.
*120494*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_050_mmr:90-830]]
Olrun.
*120495*
[[S:::1330-3270]]
Once the daughter of a powerful chieftain,
*120496*
[[S:::3690-6160]]
she fell defending him during a Reaver attack.
*120497*
[[S:::6870-8780]]
Olrun was escorted to Valhalla,
*120498*
[[S:::9210-14140]]
where she chose to devote her after-life to the pursuit of knowledge above all else.
*120499*
[[S:::15040-20750]]
Quite unusual behaviour amongst the constant drinking and feasting of her fellow Valhallian-denizens.
*120500*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_060_son:70-1250]]
How’d she end up a Valkyrie?
*120501*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_070_mmr:0-460]]
Odin.
*120502*
[[S:::950-4890]]
He saw a kindred spirit in Olrun’s single-minded pursuit of knowledge.
*120503*
[[S:::5310-8000]]
He appointed her as the Valkyrie’s resident historian.
*120504*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_080_mmr:210-4080]]
This is none other than Geirdriful, the Master of Arms in Valhalla.
*120505*
[[S:::4510-7250]]
Responsible for arming and training Odin’s einherjar.
*120506*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_090_son:40-500]]
His what?
*120507*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_100_mmr:30-4450]]
His army, come Ragnarök—the entire reason Valhalla exists, you see.
*120508*
[[S:::5050-10840]]
The einherjar wait in the great hall, endlessly feasting, drinking and fu— ahem uh… fornicating
*120509*
[[S:::10840-11520]]
themselves silly.
*120510*
[[S:::12170-16370]]
Once Ragnarök begins, Odin calls them into service to fight on his behalf.
*120511*
[[S:::16980-19500]]
Geirdriful had her hands full, training that lot.
*120512*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_110_mmr:50-1680]]
This, my friends, is Kara.
*120513*
[[S:::2150-5140]]
Now, Valkyries are volatile by nature, but Kara…
*120514*
[[S:::5550-7960]]
the lass is Wild Storm personified.
*120515*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_120_kra:70-1000]]
A wild storm…
*120516*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_130_mmr:50-2120]]
Aye, calm and collected…
*120517*
[[S:::2650-6300]]
Then the air would shift, and the fury of her storm would unleash.
*120518*
[[S:::6780-10370]]
’Twas beautiful, in a way, assuming you could find proper shelter.
*120519*
[[S:::10880-14000]]
Her tears would cleanse the blood-soaked battlefields.
*120520*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_140_mmr:20-2500]]
This is Ròta, a Chooser of the Slain.
*120521*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_150_son:70-1430]]
I thought all the Valkyrie did that?
*120522*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_160_mmr:20-1050]]
Not exactly, lad,
*120523*
[[S:::1540-5960]]
although that is what they are most famous for—and by far their greatest responsibility.
*120524*
[[S:::6480-9500]]
You’ve seen what happens to the dead without the judgement of the Valkyries.
*120525*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_170_kra:0-750]]
Hel-Walkers.
*120526*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_180_mmr:60-6470]]
That’s right. Ròta, Gunnr, Skuld… without them to clean up the aftermath of battle, Hel overflows
*120527*
[[S:::6470-8060]]
with souls meant for Valhalla.
*120528*
[[S:::8470-10050]]
A sorry state of affairs.
*120529*
[[S:::10520-12390]]
Ròta must be beside herself.
*120530*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_190_mmr:0-640]]
Ah,
*120531*
[[S:::1240-3250]]
and here we have Eir, The Healer.
*120532*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_200_son:70-1140]]
A Valkyrie healer?
*120533*
[[S:::2200-2750]]
Strange.
*120534*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_210_mmr:50-4790]]
Eir was strange, as a matter of fact. Very quiet. Very calm.
*120535*
[[S:::5370-9700]]
Where her sisters were violent rapids, Eir was a gentle stream.
*120536*
[[S:::10120-12950]]
She healed the wounds of both mortals and gods…
*120537*
[[S:::13470-18250]]
and even a certain all-knowing sage who once drank too much and fell off a mountain.
*120538*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_220_mmr:1510-2750]]
Not my proudest moment.
*120539*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_230_mmr:0-560]]
Ah.
*120540*
[[S:::910-3750]]
Göndul. Beautiful Göndul.
*120541*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_230_mmr_a:0-260]]
Ah.
*120542*
[[S:::1030-1720]]
Göndul.
*120543*
[[S:::2260-3500]]
Beautiful Göndul.
*120544*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_240_son:29-587]]
…And?
*120545*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_250_mmr:25-425]]
Hmm?
*120546*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_260_son:53-4793]]
That’s it? “Beautiful Göndul”? No story or anything?
*120547*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_270_mmr:800-1760]]
Er, sorry lad.
*120548*
[[S:::2380-5360]]
The sight of Göndul always took my breath away.
*120549*
[[S:::6310-11960]]
Göndul had a silver tongue, a sharp wit, and struck a figure so stunning, it literally drove men
*120550*
[[S:::11960-12750]]
insane.
*120551*
[[S:::13560-16310]]
Odin forbid her from setting foot in Midgard after a time,
*120552*
[[S:::16730-18990]]
as insanity is not a welcome trait in Valhalla.
*120553*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_glo_valkyrie_s175_280_mmr:0-3190]]
Well, well… Hildr. Mistress of Battle.
*120554*
[[S:::3800-5800]]
She and Odin got on quite well, actually.
*120555*
[[S:::6200-8270]]
Her and the other Valkyries… not so much.
*120556*
[[S:::8910-12650]]
She would spend most of her time here in Midgard, observing discord between the living,
*120557*
[[S:::13140-18910]]
and sowing some up herself from time to time. She lived for conflict. Some say she WAS conflict,
*120558*
[[S:::18910-19720]]
personified.
*120559*
[[S:::20370-22250]]
I wonder what will become of her, now that she’s free.
*120560*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_punch_010_son:6-673]]
Why—?
*120561*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_glo_context_punch_020_kra:0-490]]
Locked.
*120562*
[[S:::920-1930]]
This was faster.
*120563*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_punch_030_son:8-1018]]
O-kayyy.
*120564*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_firstropedown_010_kra:14-485]]
Boy.
*120565*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_firstropedown_020_son:5-455]]
Yes, sir.
*120566*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_totems_010_son:15-2512]]
That’s one. The others must be nearby.
*120567*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_totems_020_son:12-556]]
That’s two.
*120568*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_totems_030_son:27-2665]]
And that’s three. Should be able to unlock the chest now.
*120569*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_totems_040_son:0-3350]]
I think we broke all the totems. Want to go back to that chest?
*120570*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_totems_050_son:60-3703]]
We broke all three totems. Chest isn’t too far away if you want to check it.
*120571*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_totems_060_son:63-3516]]
Huh. I think the rune on that thing matched the big stone chest.
*120572*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_totems_070_son:14-626]]
Another one.
*120573*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_totems_080_son:24-4249]]
That’s three. Maybe we should go back to the chest to see if that did anything?
*120574*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stcoffin_010_son:6-510]]
Yech…
*120575*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stcoffin_020_son:8-786]]
What—?
*120576*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stcoffin_030_kra:0-1210]]
He can no longer use it.
*120577*
[[S:::1890-2670]]
We can.
*120578*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stdispel_010_son:51-2120]]
Oh – Mom taught me what to do with these…
*120579*
[[S:::3130-3826]]
Dreifa!
*120580*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_1strunemark_010_son:27-3469]]
Hunh… interesting! I may want to write that down…
*120581*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_1strunemark_020_son:30-1400]]
This should have writing on it,
*120582*
[[S:::2300-3250]]
but there’s nothing there.
*120583*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_1strunemark_030_son:40-690]]
Oh!
*120584*
[[S:::1160-2750]]
The bifrost light makes the runes appear!
*120585*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_glo_context_pilarlift_010_kra:20-1024]]
This way, boy!
*120586*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_glo_context_pilarlift_020_kra:7-631]]
Through here.
*120587*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_glo_context_pilarlift_030_kra:12-432]]
Go.
*120588*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_pilarlift_040_son:27-671]]
Coming!
*120589*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_pilarlift_050_son:15-508]]
Thanks.
*120590*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_pilarlift_060_son:0-450]]
Got it.
*120591*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_artifact_010_son:48-1639]]
Hey, that could be valuable…
*120592*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_artifact_020_son:77-1871]]
Hunh… let’s hang on to that.
*120593*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_artifact_030_son:20-1500]]
I bet there’s more where those came from.
*120594*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_artifact_040_son:15-1512]]
Oo, good find.
*120595*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_artifact_050_son:0-1570]]
Ah, more of those.
*120596*
[[S:::2250-2750]]
Good.
*120597*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_artifact_060_son:0-1210]]
One more for the collection…
*120598*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_artifact_070_son:0-1950]]
I bet that’s enough to sell to Brok or Sindri.
*120599*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_artifact_080_son:0-1700]]
I think we have a complete set of those now.
*120600*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_artifact_090_son:0-1460]]
Wanna see what we can trade those for?
*120601*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stlanguage_010_son:0-2350]]
Hey… it’s a fragment of a language cipher.
*120602*
[[S:::3050-4250]]
We should look for more like this.
*120603*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stlanguage_020_son:0-3108]]
Another cipher piece! I’ll see what I can fit together.
*120604*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stlanguage_020_son_a:0-2774]]
Another piece of the language cipher. Good.
*120605*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stlanguage_030_son:9-2389]]
Soon we’ll be able to translate those Muspelheim runes…
*120606*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stlanguage_040_son:0-2250]]
One more and we can translate those Niflheim runes…
*120607*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stlanguage_050_son:0-3470]]
Hey… this does more than decipher those Muspelheim runes—
*120608*
[[S:::4080-5600]]
it also contains the travel rune.
*120609*
[[S:::6490-7950]]
Should we go visit the Fire realm?
*120610*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stlanguage_060_son:5-5514]]
Now we can decipher those Niflheim runes. And the travel rune is here too. You want to go?
*120611*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_indeciper_001_son:47-2514]]
Hm. I don’t know these runes.
*120612*
[[S:::3465-6355]]
If we find a cipher, I bet I could figure it out.
*120613*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_indeciper_002_son:3-3583]]
I can’t read these either… but they’re different from the others.
*120614*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_indeciper_003_son:6-3650]]
We’ve seen these runes before… but it’s the kind I still can’t read.
*120615*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_indeciper_004_son:8-3900]]
Hm… this needs a different cipher than the one we have.
*120616*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_glo_context_indeciper_010_fre:48-1700]]
The tongue of Niflheim.
*120617*
[[S:::2040-4650]]
A foul place of ice and mists…
*120618*
[[S:::5210-6534]]
and Dwarven mischief.
*120619*
[[S:FREYA:vo_lvl_glo_context_indeciper_020_fre:0-5090]]
Those runes are of Muspelheim, the fire realm. No place for children,
*120620*
[[S:::5720-6750]]
even brave ones.
*120621*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_indeciper_030_son:27-6238]]
I still can’t read these.These are the ones I can’t read.I told you, we should come back with a cipher.
*120622*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_indeciper_030_son_a:7-1262]]
I still can’t read these.
*120623*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_indeciper_030_son_c:130-750]]
I told you,
*120624*
[[S:::1110-2330]]
we should come back with a cipher.
*120625*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_indeciper_030_son_b:67-1431]]
These are the ones I can’t read.
*120626*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_indeciper_040_son:0-2073]]
I can’t translate this without the whole cipher.
*120627*
[[S:::2965-6458]]
Getting a letter here and there, but we need the rest of the language disc.
*120628*
[[S:::7385-11112]]
Almost… if we could just find the other pieces of the language disc.
*120629*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_indeciper_040_son_b:0-1250]]
Getting a letter here and there,
*120630*
[[S:::1700-3250]]
but we need the rest of the language disc.
*120631*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_indeciper_040_son_a:22-2142]]
I can’t translate this without the whole cipher.

*120633*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_indeciper_050_son:30-2751]]
If I’m a god, how come I still can’t read these?
*120634*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_indeciper_060_son:11-2004]]
Shouldn’t a god just be able to read these already?
*120635*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_indeciper_070_son:15-1105]]
Can you read these, Mimir?
*120636*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_glo_context_indeciper_080_mmr:0-1080]]
Muspelheim runes?
*120637*
[[S:::1570-4000]]
No, not much opportunity for correspondence there.
*120638*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_glo_context_indeciper_090_mmr:0-4000]]
Niflheim runes? No, not much opportunity for correspondence there.
*120639*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_indeciper_100_son:0-750]]
How about these?
*120640*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_glo_context_indeciper_110_mmr:0-1470]]
No, those neither.
*120641*

I don’t think we have what we need to deal with that.
*120642*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_geargated_020_son:16-3370]]
Maybe we’ll find something we can use here. Let’s come back.
*120643*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_geargated_030_son:0-1750]]
There’s got to be a better tool for this job.
*120644*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_geargated_040_son:27-2120]]
Hm… what do we need here?
*120645*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_geargated_050_son:0-1500]]
This may need something we don’t have.
*120646*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stbramble_010_son:0-1120]]
Mom called it Hel’s bramble.
*120647*
[[S:::2220-3750]]
Can’t burn it, can’t cut it.
*120648*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_burned_010_son:0-690]]
Wow!
*120649*
[[S:::1080-3300]]

*120650*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_seesblades_010_son:60-5650]]
Those blades… how do they make fire like that? Did Brok and Sindri make those too?

[[S:::1120-1880]]
what was that?
*120653*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stdrain_020_mmr:0-2000]]
Well, that’s a bit of a story, actually…
*120654*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stdrain_030_kra:4-740]]
Later.
*120655*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_glo_context_1sttimedout_010_mmr:0-1250]]
Upp—I think it’s gone out.
*120656*

I’m afraid the winds have dissipated, brother.

Nope, we’ve lost it.

Ohh—wind’s out!

[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_triptych_first_start_010_kra:10-1329]]
Here, boy.
*120660*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_triptych_first_start_020_kra:0-1500]]
Boy, over here.
*120661*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_triptych_first_start_030_kra:0-750]]
Look here.
*120662*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_triptych_sub_start_010_kra:7-2289]]
Here, boy. Another one.
*120663*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_triptych_sub_start_020_kra:0-750]]
Another one here.
*120664*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_triptych_sub_start_030_kra:0-1450]]
Look here. Another.
*120665*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_triptych_breakout_010_kra:0-600]]
Come, boy.
*120666*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_triptych_breakout_020_kra:9-454]]
Come.
*120667*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_glo_triptych_breakout_030_kra:10-508]]
Boy.
*120668*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_triptych_breakout_010_son:0-450]]
Coming.
*120669*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_triptych_breakout_020_son:34-707]]
Right behind you.
*120670*
[[S:SON:vo_glo_triptych_breakout_030_son:0-430]]
Okay!
*120671*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stzip_010_son:19-701]]
Are we really…?
*120672*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stzip_020_son:30-1107]]
Yeah!
*120673*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stzip_030_kra:0-1350]]
Not in my ear, boy!
*120674*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stzip_040_son:530-1126]]
Sorry!
*120675*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stzip_050_son:5-786]]
That was fun.
*120676*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_ridiculous_010_son:50-1000]]
You’re in a weird mood.
*120677*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_ridiculous_020_son:20-866]]
What are you doing?
*120678*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_ridiculous_030_son:0-1450]]
Are you… exercising?
*120679*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_ridiculous_040_son:0-1500]]
I’m… not sure what you’re doing.
*120680*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_ridiculous_050_son:0-770]]
Are you…
*120681*
[[S:::1130-2180]]
teaching me something?
*120682*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_ridiculous_060_son:400-1750]]
(sigh)… why do you get this way…
*120683*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_ridiculous_070_son:69-1238]]
Why do you keep doing that?
*120684*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_ridiculous_080_son:29-1130]]
What are you trying to do?
*120685*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_ridiculous_090_son:14-1784]]
I just don’t understand you sometimes.
*120686*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_ridiculous_100_son:52-2306]]
Wh-why would you do that?
*120687*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_ridiculous_110_son:0-1350]]
You see what he’s like sometimes?
*120688*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_glo_context_ridiculous_120_mmr:0-3000]]
Aye… it’s a side I’m sure few live to witness.
*120689*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_ridiculous_130_son:0-750]]
Not NOW…
*120690*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_ridiculous_140_son:40-1171]]
Why are you LIKE THIS?
*120691*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_ridiculous_150_son:23-1253]]
What’s the MATTER with you?
*120692*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_ridiculous_160_son:15-754]]
Cut it OUT!
*120693*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_ridiculous_170_son:0-1000]]
Will you please STOP THAT?
*120694*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_ridiculous_180_son:23-1253]]
You’re doing that on purpose!
*120695*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_ridiculous_190_son:24-1420]]
We don’t have time for this right now..!
*120696*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_glo_context_ridiculous_200_mmr:0-1500]]
Brother, are you feeling alright?
*120697*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_glo_context_ridiculous_210_mmr:31-2187]]
Anything you’d like to talk about, brother?
*120698*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_glo_context_ridiculous_220_mmr:90-680]]
Oh dear…
*120699*
[[S:::1060-1750]]
have you broken?
*120700*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_wuss_010_son:0-800]]
Where’d you go?
*120701*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_wuss_020_son:32-1408]]
Did I get in the hole too soon?
*120702*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_wuss_030_son:15-822]]
Did we miss something?
*120703*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_wuss_040_son:0-1451]]
Hey, aren’t you coming?
*120704*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_wuss_050_son:0-1250]]
I thought we were going forward…
*120705*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_wuss_060_son:24-1925]]
Is it…not the only way?
*120706*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stwound_010_kra:0-900]]
Do you bleed?
*120707*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stwound_020_son:0-3928]]
Oh… a little, maybe. It doesn’t hurt.
*120708*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stwound_030_kra:14-643]]
Good.
*120709*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_1stwound_040_son:50-2790]]
I’ve always healed pretty quick. As long as I didn’t get sick…
*120710*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_1sthel_010_son:70-3280]]
That dead man… he wasn’t like the others…
*120711*
[[S:::4640-5520]]
not a Draugr.
*120712*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_glo_context_1sthel_020_kra:7-2810]]
They do seem more… human.
*120713*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_1sthel_030_son:27-3175]]
Draugr burn. These dead were cold.
*120714*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_glo_context_1sthel_040_kra:9-582]]
Hmm.
*120715*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_glo_context_goodteam_010_mmr:0-2000]]
Say, we make a pretty good team.
*120716*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_goodteam_020_son:0-1500]]
Oh yeah? What did you do?
*120717*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_glo_context_goodteam_030_mmr:60-1750]]
Well, I nearly lost a tooth…
*120718*
[[S:MIMIR:vo_lvl_glo_context_whathel_010_mmr:0-1740]]
Never seen one of those before.
*120719*
[[S:::2150-4227]]
They look like they walked straight out of Hel!
*120720*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_blades_010_son:30-5830]]
Those blades… how do they make fire like that? Did Brok and Sindri make those too?
*120721*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_killogre_010_son:46-952]]
It’s funny…
*120722*
[[S:::1640-3940]]
The first ogre we fought said you smelled
*120723*
[[S:::4550-5874]]
like a god… I thought he was just insulting you.
*120724*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_jerkkill_010_son:0-1440]]
They just never learn, do they?
*120725*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_jerkkill_020_son:0-1400]]
Keep on gettin’ in our way!
*120726*
[[S:::1565-2400]]
See what you get!
*120727*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_jerkkill_030_son:31-2541]]
Ugh, enough of these guys.
*120728*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_jerkkill_040_son:41-2647]]
Pff—this used to be a challenge.
*120729*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_jerkkill_050_son:77-2576]]
Look at that… struck down by the gods.
*120730*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_jerkkill_060_son:107-3176]]
To think I used to feel bad killing these guys….
*120731*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_jerkkill_070_son:0-750]]
I got that one.
*120732*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_jerkkill_080_son:8-905]]
Took care of that one.
*120733*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_jerkkill_090_son:7-1043]]
That’s the end of you.
*120734*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_jerkkill_100_son:3-1008]]
Back to Hel with you!
*120735*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_hearthstone_010_son:0-1000]]
Oh yeah!
*120736*
[[S:::1370-2350]]
Brok’s medallion…
*120737*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_stonetroll_010_son:0-2390]]
Great—I guess they’re all coming to life now.
*120738*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_no_mountain_010_son:0-800]]
Aw…!
*120739*
[[S:::1390-3000]]
Why can’t we take this up to the mountain?
*120740*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_glo_context_no_mountain_020_mmr:0-2830]]
If Brok’s been messin’ at it again, best leave it be.
*120741*
[[S:::3260-4750]]
Reality is unstable enough!
*120742*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_glo_context_no_mountain_030_kra:0-700]]
No matter.
*120743*
[[S:::1210-2000]]
We will walk.
*120744*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_glo_context_no_mountain_post_010_mmr:0-861]]
Broken…
*120745*
[[S:::1230-6000]]
wonder if Modi was somehow able to sever its connection to the World Tree to funnel us here?
*120746*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_raven_010_son:0-1530]]
If those are Odin’s ravens,
*120747*
[[S:::2240-3600]]
should we really be killing them?
*120748*
[[S:::4500-5750]]
Are we trying to get him angry?
*120749*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_glo_context_raven_020_kra:100-1240]]
If they are spies,
*120750*
[[S:::1740-2500]]
they are a threat.
*120751*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_raven_030_son:0-1590]]
Well, in that case…
*120752*
[[S:::2320-3360]]
you’d better kill them all.
*120753*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_nochisel_010_son:0-810]]
Hunh…
*120754*
[[S:::2150-5399]]
how do we get through a seal like that? Is it magic?
*120755*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_glo_context_nochisel_020_kra:60-3170]]
If we find the magic to open it, perhaps we will return.
*120756*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_nochisel_030_son:4-776]]
Do you promise?
*120757*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_glo_context_nochisel_040_kra:13-758]]
I do not.
*120758*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_first_off_crit_010_son:0-750]]
Oh…
*120759*
[[S:::1330-3220]]
is that why you wanted to come back here…
*120760*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_jerkrefusal_010_son:5-977]]
What are you waiting for?
*120761*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_glo_context_jerkrefusal_020_kra:0-2250]]
No.  We go only to the summit.
*120762*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_jerkrefusal_030_son:0-500]]
How come?
*120763*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_glo_context_jerkrefusal_040_kra:10-1400]]
Look to your behaviour.
*120764*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_jerkrefusal_050_son:6-1225]]
I thought we weren’t exploring.
*120765*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_glo_context_jerkrefusal_060_kra:12-922]]
We are NOT.
*120766*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_library_found_010_son:0-740]]
Hunh….
*120767*
[[S:::2090-3710]]
Why would someone hide a library?
*120768*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_glo_context_library_found_020_mmr:0-1770]]
Information and secrecy?
*120769*
[[S:::2260-3682]]
Sounds like Odin…
*120770*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_library_found_030_son:0-1502]]
I’ve seen this language before…
*120771*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_glo_context_library_found_040_mmr:0-3996]]
The secret language of the Travellers. For Odin’s eye only.
*120772*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_library_found_050_son:0-1190]]
Another hidden library.
*120773*
[[S:::1900-4060]]
So these are all reports from Odin’s spies?
*120774*
[[S:MIMIRS HEAD:vo_lvl_glo_context_library_found_060_mmr:0-3250]]
Clues towards finding a path to Jötunheim, and other obsessions.
*120775*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_library_found_070_son:0-1110]]
One more hidden library.
*120776*
[[S:::2510-4750]]
Odin’s really been after Jötunheim a long time…
*120777*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_glo_context_chest_lock_010_kra:0-1717]]
Here. What does it say?
*120778*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_chest_lock_020_son:0-2000]]
“The guardians of renewal be thrice shattered.”
*120779*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_chest_lock_030_son:9-1737]]
The runes symbolise the three Nornir.
*120780*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_glo_context_chest_lock_040_kra:0-700]]
Nornir?
*120781*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_chest_lock_050_son:6-653]]
The fates.
*120782*
[[S:KRATOS:vo_lvl_glo_context_chest_lock_060_kra:6-3487]]
The fates. No good comes from them.
*120783*
[[S:SON:vo_lvl_glo_context_chest_lock_070_son:0-250]]
Why don’t we look around?
*120784*
[[S:SON:vo_glb_bntr_troll1_2_start_010_son:50-1320]]
That was just one troll.
*120785*
[[S:::2560-4740]]
Mother said there were nine tormenting the realms.
*120786*
[[S:::5790-7380]]
I’m not sure I want to see the other eight.
*120787*
[[S:SON:vo_glb_bntr_troll1_2_start_020_son:30-2500]]
I guess Midgard is a little bit safer now that he’s gone.
*120788*
[[S:SON:vo_glb_bntr_troll3_7_mid_010_son:69-941]]
Another troll!
*120789*
[[S:SON:vo_glb_bntr_troll3_7_mid_020_son:31-1198]]
One less to worry about.
*120790*
[[S:SON:vo_glb_bntr_troll3_7_mid_030_son:59-1105]]
Another one down.
*120791*
[[S:SON:vo_glb_bntr_troll3_7_mid_040_son:40-1640]]
We took down a lot of trolls.
*120792*
[[S:::2370-3500]]
I wonder how many are left?
*120793*
[[S:SON:vo_glb_bntr_troll8_9_end_010_son:0-1750]]
We have almost rid the world of the Trolls.
*120794*
[[S:SON:vo_glb_bntr_troll8_9_end_020_son:0-500]]
Only Two more Trolls to go!
*120795*
[[S:SON:vo_glb_bntr_troll8_9_end_030_son:13-1263]]
Only one more Troll left!
*120796*
[[S:SON:vo_glb_bntr_troll8_9_end_040_son:34-1937]]
That’s it.  They are all dead.
*120797*
[[S:SON:vo_glb_bntr_troll8_9_end_050_son:0-770]]
All of them.
*120798*
[[S:::1790-3140]]
There will never be another troll.
*120799*
[[S:::5830-7250]]
I guess I should feel good…
*120800*
[[S:::8140-8510]]
I mean,
*120801*
[[S:::9240-11040]]
they caused this world nothing but suffering…
*120802*
[[S:::12260-12470]]
but…
*120803*
[[S:::13990-15000]]
I just feel nothing.
